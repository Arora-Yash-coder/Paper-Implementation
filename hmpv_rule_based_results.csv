Yes. If any one of those virus variant from the set of viruses causing common cold like symptoms, progresses further and causes severe symptoms, then it would be classified as a seperate infection and given a seperate name.   

By this definition (and most probably) COVID-19 is a type of common cold virus. If it did not cause severe symptoms or high rate of infection then it would be literally classified as common cold. Heck, the ultimate fate of COVID-19 (by most estimated consensus) is that it will become a part of common cold. As much was said when I was infected with COVID-19 recently - no major symptoms other than light stuffy nose and body pain and my wife literally has no symptoms.

I do think there should be investigations because of the history of these types of corporations and government agencies. And whether or not they lied, they *have* profited off of Covid.",thats fair the american healthcare industry has done a lot of shady things over the years i think right now is probably the most transparent the healthcare industry has ever been due to the internet and the ability to share information so quickly there is a lot of distrust in these systems and the establishment that allowed for itprofited from it thats not to say that the healthcare industry manipulated and lied to citizens to make money during covid i just dont think the healthcare industry gets the right to say well when have we ever lied to the public as a defense no matter if they lied during covid i just want people to know the truth but i dont have an answer you dont have an answer no one in the public really knows for sure i do think there should be investigations because of the history of these types of corporations and government agencies and whether or not they lied they have profited off of covid,0.6843,1,0.2024801587301587,1

To avoid it, clean surfaces often used by others, and for the love of god WASH YOUR HANDS!!! There is no vaccine or antiviral therapy to treat the disease itself. The disease usually lasts 7-10 days, so similarly to covid.

17,"We are seeing very sick children right now with pneumonia on top of flu. It is bad, bad, bad across the country.

The triad of low oxygen plus fast respiratory rate plus fatigue/increased work of breathing is what comes before they drop off that cliff. Unfortunately, kids are NOT adults; they exhaust their reserve without many signs that the collapse is immanent. You can't wait until they ""look worse."" This is what they look like when they are in crisis.

Please let them take her to the hospital in the ambulance. Honestly, although triage shouldn't work this way, it may make it even an inch more likely to get the last bed there. The last night I was on call, I spent the next day pulling together the direct line numbers for ""transfer centers"" (or the equivalent) for children's hospitals in the surrounding seven states.

I'd had to call four children's hospitals before I could find one for transfer. Well, one of them would have taken her, but there was a 24 hour wait expected -- and we don't have kid-sized ventilators here. The last time I saw one like this, we did intubate and just tried our best while awaiting transport.

Children's hospitals are in crisis. This is our version of the 2019 surge. RSV and flu are hitting hard, and COVID is still there, but it's the secondary pneumonias that are doing them in. Check out the nursing subreddit. Nurses without experience in pediatrics are being pulled in, including to NICUs and PICUs.

The hospital will work with you. There is some specific language to use when asking for aid if you are in that hole between Medicaid and being able to pay. We will help you. Please get her safe.

17,"I’m sorry this is happening to your daughter.

There is no safe option other than the ambulance ride with the oxygen mask.

Speak with the hospital social worker while she is admitted. If you are under a certain income level, it is likely that your daughter will qualify for a state-funded children’s health care plan. If she qualifies, this will be retroactive to the care she is about to receive, since she qualified all along.

If not, ask about applying for charity care/bill forgiveness through the hospital. This option will take perseverance, but there are organizations that can help you advocate for yourself if you get a bill that seems unfair.

Hey sweetie I negotiate hospital bills for a living. I want to let you know that what you’re feeling is normal, but only because people don’t understand how not serious this is. So take a few deep breaths and let me explain…

Insurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf. We frequently gets these bills reduced by 40, 50, 60%. This has caused providers to pad their bills, knowing they will only receive a small portion. That, plus all the uninsured folks who never pay, means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic services.

You do not have to pay this bill. Ever. They can’t do anything to you. No one will force you. It will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt. This is America. Literally everyone has medical debt. It won’t stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house. It doesn’t make a difference.

In a few years, the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar. Then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times, trying to settle with you. At this point, if you want to settle, offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full. They will likely take it.

If you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you’re making the payments, it won’t get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).

Please don’t do anything drastic. The system is fucked and it’s supposed to make you scared and nervous so that you sell your baby to pay the bills. In the end, the hospital knows they have no leverage against you so they want to make everything complicated and intimidating. Don’t let them win. You got this.",the following is not my comment but i saw it elsewhere on reddit today sorry i dont have the redditors name hey sweetie i negotiate hospital bills for a living i want to let you know that what youre feeling is normal but only because people dont understand how not serious this is so take a few deep breaths and let me explaininsurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf we frequently gets these bills reduced by    this has caused providers to pad their bills knowing they will only receive a small portion that plus all the uninsured folks who never pay means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic servicesyou do not have to pay this bill ever they cant do anything to you no one will force you it will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt this is america literally everyone has medical debt it wont stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house it doesnt make a differencein a few years the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times trying to settle with you at this point if you want to settle offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full they will likely take itif you still want to pay before it gets sent to collections which i would never do call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill it will be significantly smaller then ask for a self pay discount it will be substantial then ask the make monthly payments it can be a couple bucks a month as  long as youre making the payments it wont get sent to collections which even if it does who caresplease dont do anything drastic the system is fucked and its supposed to make you scared and nervous so that you sell your baby to pay the bills in the end the hospital knows they have no leverage against you so they want to make everything complicated and intimidating dont let them win you got this,-0.9772,-1,-0.08685897435897434,0

I can’t give solid advice like doctors on here, but I can tell you that if it stays in that low range (90 or under for longer than a few hours): A) you need to be treating him with the albuterol nebulizer machine as prescribed to open up his airways - do you have a nebulizer machine at home? It’s a must for anyone with asthma. B) if the nebulizer isn’t bringing up his numbers, or if you don’t have a nebulizer and his numbers stay that low for a while, it’s best to take him in. Reason for this is that his low blood oxygen is depriving his tissues and organs of necessary oxygen to sustain themself; meaning long term can have bad consequences. With that being said, when the o2 is that low, it makes your heart work faster to keep up with the lack of oxygen that the blood isn’t giving.

If it were me in your situation, if I couldn’t get his numbers up with lying still and albuterol treatments, I wouldn’t let it go on for more than an hour or two.

Edit: Agrego que debido a diversos factores los números están lejos de ser exactos, especialmente en el caso de las muertes. Sea por problemas de organización e infraestructura, por atribuirle la muerte a otros padecimientos, por cuestiones políticas, etc.

However, I believe that HMPV has the potential to become something much worse. Just like how the coronavirus was initially downplayed and then became a global issue, the same could happen with HMPV. In the next few weeks, we might see it turn into something completely new or a more infectious variant. 

I canceled a family trip to Italy in late February 2020, against everyone’s advice. It was a significant financial loss since most of the expenses were non-refundable, but we avoided a lot of trouble by not traveling.

29,"Is HMPV worse than COVID?

Experts say the HMPV outbreak in China is not of major concern — it is neither a new, mystery illness nor responsible for as many cases as COVID or other infections even this season. According to the latest CDC data, HMPV accounts for less than 2% of weekly positive tests of respiratory viruses. In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week. 

For a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks. At 1.9%, Garcia Carreno said it's not close to the numbers of flu, COVID and RSV.

> This makes it the first case in India amid a surge in such cases in China. According to News18, the child does not have any travel history. The case was confirmed by the Karnataka Health Department. The case was reportedly conveyed to the Union Health Ministry.  According to News 18,It was not clear whether this was the same strain of HMPV causing a spike in China.

Read the last statement. 

> it was not clear whether this was the same strain of HMPV causing a spike in China.

There are many variants of HMPV, it's a group of Paramyxoviridae family of viruses, these viruses peak during the winter season, it's been there everywhere in the world since thousands of years. 

We can't say anything unless it is confirmed that it is the same variant of HMPV from China which is rapidly spreading there, there are other variants everywhere in the world that are least harmful (and even we don't know as of now that HMPV variant in China is harmful or not). 

I guess it's least likely to be HMPV China variant because the family doesn't have any travel history and neither they were in contact with anyone who had a international travel history according to the news.

Just be cautious however, wear a mask in crowded places but dont panic, irrespective of whether it's the Chinese variant or not, a viral flu is still dangerous for kids and the old.",from the article this makes it the first case in india amid a surge in such cases in chinaaccording tonews the child does not have any travel historythe case was confirmed by the karnataka health departmentthe case was reportedly conveyed to the union health ministry according to news it was not clear whether this was the same strain of hmpv causing a spike in chinaread the last statement  it was not clear whether this was the same strain of hmpv causing a spike in chinathere are many variants of hmpv its a group of paramyxoviridae family of viruses these viruses peak during the winter season its been there everywhere in the world since thousands of years we cant say anything unless it is confirmed that it is the same variant of hmpv from china which is rapidly spreading there there are other variants everywhere in the world that are least harmful and even we dont know as of now that hmpv variant in china is harmful or not i guess its least likely to be hmpv china variant because the family doesnt have any travel history and neither they were in contact with anyone who had a international travel history according to the newsjust be cautious however wear a mask in crowded places but dont panic irrespective of whether its the chinese variant or not a viral flu is still dangerous for kids and the old,-0.104,-1,0.011842105263157878,0

43,"Nivel de incompetență nu încetează să mă uimească, atât de la presă cât și de la autoritățile locale. HMPV este endemic în toată lumea. Las mai jos conținutul unei postări făcute de Dr. Mihai Craiu.

___
Acesta nu este un tablou al unui pictor modern! Deși ar putea semăna cu anemonele lui Luchian, sau mai bine cu cele ale lui Gustav Klimt, acestea nu sunt niște flori.

Așa arată la microscopul electronic hMPV (faimosul metapneumovirus uman) care a generat emoții și discuții aprinse în ultimele zile. Da, în multe țari asiatice s-a observat o creștere a numărului de cazuri de infectare cu hMPV la copiii cu vârstă sub 14 ani și la seniori sau la cei cu imunodeficiență. - link în comentarii

Dar cam atât! Să ne uităm întâi la ce este cunoscut, înainte de a genera alte mesaje foarte alarmiste🤗

Pentru majoritatea pediatrilor nu a fost nicio surpriză! Virusul a fost descris în 2001 de către dr Bernadette van den Hoogen la copii răciți din Olanda, deși el exista de multă vreme. Se estimează ca el s-a desprins dintr-o familie de virusuri similare ce infectează păsările. Acum aproximativ 400 de ani.

Nu am știut să îl detectăm până acum dar el există de foarte multă vreme.

Eu am un slide dedicat hMPV, în cursul despre bronșiolita acută pe care îl țin la studenți, de peste 15 ani.

În 2012 am publicat, alături de colegii de la Spitalul Grigore Alexandrescu și de colectivul de experți ai Centrului Național de Referință în Boli Respiratorii de la Institutul Cantacuzino (condus la acea vreme de către dna dr Cristina Țecu) rezultatele unei cercetări ce își dorea să evalueze ce virusuri produc boli respiratorii  cu spitalizare (cum ar fi bronșiolita acută sau pneumonia) la copii.

Cel mai frecvent identificați, la acel moment, au fost VSR (virusul sincițial respirator), hMPV și adenovirus. Link in comentarii

Deci nimic nou sub soare🤗

De unde emoția? Pentru că vorbim despre un virus obișnuit, din familia Paramyxoviridae, rudă cu virusul rujeolos, de exemplu.

Probabil ne-am speriat din cauza faptului că ACUM stim că există acest ""dușman"", pentru că putem testa PCR-multiplex, în timp real, un număr extrem mare de persoane. Este moștenirea pandemiei...

Aceste teste PCR-multiplex pot identifica rapid peste 20 de virusuri și bacterii din secrețiile nazale ale unui bolnav.

Deci acum AM AFLAT cu toții că există hMPV, deși el era pe podium, alaturi de VSR și rhinovirusuri drept cauză a bolilor respiratorii. Este atât de frecvent încât 90% din copiii care merg la grădiniță vor face până la 5 ani o infecție cu hMPV. Și pentru că imunitatea pentru acest virus ""nu ține"", boala se poate repeta oricând.

La fel ca și la gripă, au fost descrise 4 tipuri de hMPV, în funcție de proteinele de suprafață F (de fuziune) și G (de atașament) care sunt  notate cu A1, A2, B1 și B2.

Este o simplă răceală pentru persoanele adulte sănatoase sau pentru copiii mai mari. Poate ceva mai zgomotoasă în 2025 decât în alți ani, dar cam atât.

Soluția?? Avem răbdare, luăm antitermice și ne hidratăm bine. Dacă e rău în continuare după 2-3 zile mergem la medic.

Și nu dăm și altora boala!!! Adică respectăm eticheta tusei, ne izolăm câteva zile și spălăm bine mâinile.

Multă sănătate!

SARS-CoV-1 și 2 fac parte din genul Betacoronavirus (alături de MERS-CoV) dar sunt unice în subgenul Sarbecovirus. Adică până în 2020, SARS-CoV-1 era singurul Sarbecovir. Ambele SARS-CoV au un strămoș comun, având o similaritate genetică reciprocă de ~80%. Practic asta l-a făcut ""novel human coronavirus"", diferența genetică față de cele cunoscute și faptul că nu a mai fost detectat în oameni până atunci.

HMPV face parte din genul Metapneumovirus, dar nu este mai departe segmentat în subgenuri, ci în linii genetice (A/B). Toate cazurile de HMPV genotipate până acum nu au indicat existența unei noi linii genetice, deci nu este ""novel"".

45,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

> Pandemics are rare

With the advent of mass industrial animal agriculture as well as the rise of wet markets in Asia, the risk of major pandemics rises. A lot. This is something which has been understood since the 1970s, that the potential for viruses to mutate with a much wider variety of animals increases due to modern agricultural methods. 

SARS, in 2002-2003, was contained before it spread too much. We were *extraordinarily* lucky to contain it, and it took a combined effort of dozens of countries mobilizing lockdowns and restrictions to take it down. If it had spread to pandemic levels, and it was a *high chance* it would have if we didn't catch it early, it had a death rate of 8-12%. Aka hundreds of millions dead. SARS uniquely spread due to wet markets. It is a pandemic which never would have happened without those modern factors mentioned above. Same with Covid. 

>  every one is an existential crisis according to the media fear machine.

RSV and Norovirus were never viewed as 'pandemics'. Norovirus can come in waves and be awful to go through (my family just had it... awful), but nobody views it as a crisis. Its still news worthy when cases spike in your city, but you are being dishonest trying to say its viewed as an existential crisis. 

The real issue is Bird Flu. That is a genuinely *massive* concern and should not be downplayed. There is not an epidemiologist in the world right now which is not extremely concerned about bird flu mutating for human transmissibility. It has spread to animal populations worldwide at a rate we have never seen in the past year, and is rapidly approaching the ability to cause human to human transmission. Bird flu has a mortality rate of 40%. This is not something to scoff at.

(I followed up on the WMF T&S team's internal messaging - T383236 on the WMF Phabricator if anybody cares - and the T&S team are insisting that this isn't a big deal, lmao)

* A lot of Richmond, Virginia has been screwed by a sudden water infrastructure collapse.

* Campaigning continues for the German elections in February and the prospect of non-AFD turnout collapsing is very scary, especially since the SPD, CDU and GRUNE are saying that the Dunkelflaute was a one-off and that everything is under control. Maybe it won't happen. Musk has been aggressively pro-AFD online and is probably doing illegal stuff in support of them already.

56,"It’s early Monday morning, January 13, 2025, and Los Angeles feels quiet. 

The skies are clear, schools will reopen, and the general vibe is that the worst is behind us. Fires have burned nearly 40,000 acres, 24 people have died, and containment on the two largest blazes—the Palisades and Eaton Fires—sits at 13% and 27%, respectively...those are unsettlingly low numbers, and with Santa Ana winds building tonight and peaking Tuesday, the risks ahead feel undeniable.

I've been discussing this with a few friends I have in LA, they've said we don't have to worry as Sunday was definitely a better day. Although, here’s what the conditions suggest could happen over the next 48 hours:

1. Winds will escalate the fires. Winds don’t arrive all at once—they build. Starting tonight, gusts will climb to 30–60 mph, drying out vegetation and carrying embers 1–2 miles ahead of the fireline. By Tuesday morning, spot fires could ignite in urban neighborhoods like Brentwood, Santa Monica, and Venice. Fragile containment lines will likely fail, and the fires will spread into areas that feel “safe” right now.
2. Air quality will plummet. Smoke and ash will blanket much of LA by Monday afternoon, with air quality reaching hazardous levels (AQI 300–400). Outdoor activity will become dangerous even far from the flames, and ash will cover streets and cars across the city.
3. Evacuations and gridlock will follow. Expanded evacuation orders in urban zones will overwhelm the 405, 10 Freeway, and Sunset Blvd. Schools reopening Monday morning may close abruptly as conditions worsen, adding to the traffic chaos.
4. Rolling blackouts and resource strain. Utilities will likely shut off power in high-risk zones to prevent further ignitions, leaving thousands without electricity or reliable communication. Fire crews will shift from containment to structure defense, stretching resources thin.
5. By Tuesday, LA could feel apocalyptic. Fires doubling in size. Ash falling everywhere. Smoke making the city feel unlivable.

This isn’t a guarantee, but the conditions are all there for this to happen. Fires don’t need to be visible or close to your block to cause chaos. Embers can travel miles ahead of the fireline, sparking new blazes in areas that seem calm today.

LA is walking into a pivotal 48 hours. By the time people realize the scale of what’s happening, it may already feel like a different city.

    A study in Communications Medicine suggests that, for some patients, the drug Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) may help alleviate some symptoms of Long COVID, at least in the short-term. This account from a Long COVID sufferer explains what the experience of Long COVID can be like, and summarizes much of the scientific understanding of the illness. Another study published last week links Long COVID to “neuro-degenerative processes, including Alzheimer’s disease.”




I don't know if it's just me, but it creeps me out more than I can express that so many people seem totally apathetic and blase about this. The implications of this are absolutely terrifying and yet tons of people just waltz around like nothing's wrong, referring to the pandemic in the past tense like it was just a bad year and just going out and risking their health and their lives like they don't mean anything at all. 



    The United States recorded its first human death from bird flu last week in a Louisiana patient. Officials believe the deceased contracted the virus from his/her backyard brood of chickens, which got sick from an interaction with wild birds. One human infection in San Francisco recorded last week seems to have had no known source of infection. Recent human infections are worrying some who believe it will become our next devastating global pandemic.

60,"With Trump coming, it is good for India. No one is looking at the fact that the tariffs are country specific, and not winder generic tariffs. people pick up a word from the stupid media and run with it. the tariffs are on china, canada, mexico. not on india. first get your facts straight.

Trump coming will be good for india. as rupee against dollar falls, indian stocks will be more attractive per dollar as they get more worth for each dollar. so they will rush into the indian markets more. the fall is to recover dollars right now, so that when rupee goes down, as it will, they are pump in the money in dollars more. So markets will rally in a few months once rupee cross 90-95 mark.

Indian budget is something that only indians panic over. FII dont bother much as they can take their money elsewhere anytime. The budget will frankly be worse, cause the push is to make the markets more reliant on the country's money and not FII. For that you need ways to reduce FII dependency on the stock market prices. so in the short run markets will fall but FII will lose more if they pull back.

HMPV is nothing like COVID - but markets will immediately bounce back if they fall - no one took COVID seriously in the beginning, and then we all saw what happened. No surprises there.

The real thing to worry about - the housing bubble in US. 2007-08 crash soon to repeat - debt is at all time high. US employment data has been manipulated left and right. Student loans and housing loans ballooning up but real data is not being shown - its waiting for Trump to come. Jan-end is when the BLS will release employment data for the Dec-24 quarter end. Markets likely to crash in Feb-Apr period. about 40%.

IDK what it is yet, but something wonderful will come out of all these.",with trump coming it is good for india no one is looking at the fact that the tariffs are country specific and not winder generic tariffs people pick up a word from the stupid media and run with it the tariffs are on china canada mexico not on india first get your facts straighttrump coming will be good for india as rupee against dollar falls indian stocks will be more attractive per dollar as they get more worth for each dollar so they will rush into the indian markets more the fall is to recover dollars right now so that when rupee goes down as it will they are pump in the money in dollars more so markets will rally in a few months once rupee cross  markindian budget is something that only indians panic over fii dont bother much as they can take their money elsewhere anytime the budget will frankly be worse cause the push is to make the markets more reliant on the countrys money and not fii for that you need ways to reduce fii dependency on the stock market prices so in the short run markets will fall but fii will lose more if they pull backhmpv is nothing like covid  but markets will immediately bounce back if they fall  no one took covid seriously in the beginning and then we all saw what happened no surprises therethe real thing to worry about  the housing bubble in us  crash soon to repeat  debt is at all time high us employment data has been manipulated left and right student loans and housing loans ballooning up but real data is not being shown  its waiting for trump to come janend is when the bls will release employment data for the dec quarter end markets likely to crash in febapr period about   but out of all these  something amazing will come  idk what it is yet but something wonderful will come out of all these,-0.946,-1,0.2122668650793651,1

HMPV was first isolated in 2001, and scientists have discovered that the virus and infection has been around for at least 50 years before that. In fact, HMPV is the 2nd leading cause of respiratory diseases amongst children in the US. Although no vaccine is available yet, Moderna did Phase 1 trials of a candidate vaccine back in 2019, before being pushed back due to the CoViD outbreak.

So we are better prepared to tackle HMPV than we were for CoV.

HMPV also is the virus which has been in our world through 60 years and isn't really concerning virus. Instead it's a mild one and can be dealt with easily.
Plus the cases which are recorded in India and the ones infected don't have any travel history either, again proving the point that the virus would just show up randomly.

Last but not least, HMPV isn't new like COVID was so there is no reason to panic and start a pandemic warning.

69,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

>Cases of human metapneumovirus, or HMPV, spiked this spring, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s respiratory virus surveillance systems. It filled hospital intensive care units with young children and seniors who are the most vulnerable to these infections.

>Most people who caught it probably didn’t even know they had it, however. Sick people aren’t usually tested for it outside of a hospital or ER.

>The infection generates weak or incomplete immune protection, however, and humans get reinfected throughout their lives.

COVID is an abbreviation for **CO**rona**VI**rus **D**isease. It is not a genus and has nothing to do with scientific nomenclature. It was a convenient name to use so people didn't keep panicking whenever the acronym SARS came up. COVID-19 was caused by *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* (so the genus is *Betacoronavirus*), which is the same species which caused SARS in 2001.

Forcing us to get all scientific here rams the point home. *Human metapneumovirus* is a species isolated in 2001. *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* is a species which caused an epidemic in 2001. Yes, they both already have existed in humans for some time, that doesn't mean new variants don't appear (as the new variant which caused COVID-19 suddenly appeared).

Layman here, but still...

As far as I understand, it's natural killer cells that eat viruses and neutrophils that go after bacteria. Killer T cells can attack both, but they need antigen tags to work and so take a bit longer. I know that the lymphocytes increased by viral infection are different enough from those increased in bacterial infection that specifically viral infections can provoke both onset and attacks of autoimmune disease. Or at least there's a not insignificant correlation that does not exist for bacterial illness.

The idea that the immune cells are too tired after fighting one kind of infection that it can't fight another sort. Not how it works and they largely aren't the same immune cells. Strikes me like saying because some of the army's been busy, the navy is unable to handle enemy ships at port. I know it's not quite that separate, but it's certainly far from the same.

Yay!

Now I'm dreaming of being able to force him to learn about the innate and the adaptive immune system, how that'd break his brain and how he'd break the learning in return. I mean, I love how it'd mean he'd know more about how vaccines as well as allergies work. As well as how ""reducing the immune system"" is actually good for some people. (If what he's said about covid shots was right, auto-immune world be excitedly crowing about it to this day!)

But then, how would he screw it up? Definitely going to conflate natural killer cells, natural killer t-cells, and killer t-cells all to heck. Maybe even t-cells generally as a bonus. Bet ""natural killer cells"" would become the baddies, which is funny because they're definitely a hero here, but misidentifying hero and villain is Alex all over, itn't it? And it would prove he's fighting on the side of not just covid, but viruses generally (and cancer to boot, right?) Ha! Memory cells, though, those would be awfully enticing. There's memory b's and memory t's... which he'd definitely screw up. Both the linguistically plausible combinations could be useful to him. He'll have a greater amount of memory P cells, P for prophecy through which god grants him his powers. And papa will be able to increase everyone's memory d cells through vitamin sales, right?

Hospitals across China are overcrowded as the CCP virus outbreak continues

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, and many people say that it is comparable to the COVID-19 outbreak three years ago.

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, with a large number of children and adults showing symptoms of fever and colds . The official name was “influenza A” and “human metapneumovirus”, but many people said that this wave of so-called “flu” was comparable to the outbreak of the new coronavirus three years ago. Videos of crowded children’s hospitals across China have been circulating on social media platforms in recent days, with many children showing symptoms such as fever and cough. A netizen posted a video saying that the “flu” this winter is as powerful as the new coronavirus three years ago . All the hospital beds are occupied. Not only the pediatric department, but also the adult department is overcrowded. Many young and elderly people are infected and have fever.

There are also videos showing that in some hospitals’ pediatric departments, there are still many people queuing up for medical treatment late at night. Some parents even arrive at the hospital in the early morning to queue up for a number, and the infusion room is crowded with people. The Chinese Communist Party’s official media claimed that this wave of infection was caused by the outbreak of “H1N1”. However, many mainland netizens said that the symptoms of H1N1 are exactly the same as those of the new coronavirus. On December 25, the video blogger “Please Fei Ge” said that he and his wife went to Guangzhou to attend an event recently. After returning, they both had a fever, repeated high fevers, body aches, and headaches, just like the feeling of being positive that year. Later, it was learned that all 8 or 9 people who attended the event were infected with “A-type influenza”. In order to avoid infecting their children, he and his wife have been isolated for three days, and they still have a low-grade fever. He reminded everyone: “This feeling is exactly the same as when I got yang back then. It’s very uncomfortable. If you still remember that feeling, wear a mask when you go out in crowded places.” Many netizens on Chinese social platforms have reported that there have been collective infections among people around them. Netizen “色甘酸本色” said on Weibo on December 27: “A professor of infectious diseases at a hospital in a certain country gave a lecture and said that the number of patients in the fever clinic soared from 30 per day to 120 per day within a week. Of course, the good news is that the vast majority of patients who come here are ‘influenza A’. The bad news is that the symptoms of patients are often quite severe. The good news is that patients in the fever clinic generally do not need to be hospitalized. The bad news is that the positive rate of detection in hospitalized critically ill patients is also very high.” “Fang Naoke Deng Boyun” said: “All employees of the community bank have been infected with ‘H1N1’. What happened to the promise that financial industry workers would be the least affected after the opening up? My mother called the branch secretary of her former unit today to inquire about her retirement benefits. The branch secretary is lying at home with a fever. It’s not good to be a ‘lying-down cadre’.”

This pot is not that Hu. I just want to stretch my waist again.” said: “At least four offices in our unit have collectively laid down.” “Pottery Jar” said: “H1N1 is rampant in my workplace.” “The next door prince’s Weibo” said bluntly: “It’s COVID-19 positive.” Li Hongye, chief physician of women and children at Zhumadian Central Hospital, told Elephant News: “The flu has entered an outbreak period. According to the hospital’s epidemiological survey, the number of patients in December increased tenfold compared to November.” On December 27, Kan Biao, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference, “The recent upward trend in the positive detection rate of influenza viruses has been obvious. We have entered the seasonal epidemic period and will continue to rise for some time to come.” He also claimed that the new coronavirus infection is now at a relatively low epidemic level. The China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminds that human metapneumovirus has entered its peak period, and the symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory pathogen infections. There are currently no specific drugs or vaccines . Some netizens bluntly said that this was another outbreak of the “new crown”.

This week's theme was pink eye, strep and a 'lingering cold.'. Not to much GI stuff yet.  We had a few Covid+ this week. 

As far as staffing goes, our nursing team  is nearly fully staffed if you count out the fact that we have 2 FT positions open and 3 travelers. We were getting incentive for picking up extra shifts but because we're fully staffed they took it away.   When management calls me to pick up extra, my answer is no.

103,"Vừa mới tham khảo báo BBC và New York Times.

Thì con virus này nó nguy hiểm hơn cảm cúm bình thường, nhưng không nguy hiểm như sars covid 19 hay các loại virus cúm khác. Ở các quốc gia lạnh như tàu khựa, đông đúc, chen chúc, thì bệnh nó dễ lây lan hơn, với lại, tàu khựa nó không có nền y tế tốt như châu âu hay mỹ, và hệ miễn dịch của dân tàu khựa nó rất yếu, nên bị quá tải bệnh viện là chuyện đương nhiên. 

Trước hết thì không nên hoảng sợ, lo lắng một đại dịch như là Covid 19. Vì đây là một loại virus rất phổ biến, có từ rất lâu và đã được phát hiện từ tận hồi 2001. Nó sống chung với loài người mấy thập kỷ rồi, các triệu chứng thì vẫn giống như cảm, ảnh hưởng nhiều nhất là hệ hô hấp. 

Nhưng. Nếu bạn đang sống ở việt nam, một nơi có khí hậu, chất lượng không khí tồi tệ, môi trường sống bẩn thỉu. Và bạn nghĩ rằng bạn có một hệ miễn dịch kém. Thì bạn nên đeo khẩu trang, tránh nơi đông người nếu có thể, thường xuyên rửa tay bằng sản phẩm sát khuẩn. Đi khám khi có các triệu chứng (triệu chứng thế nào thì chịu khó lên mạng tham khảo). 

Có thể là do hậu covid, chích mấy cái vaccine của tàu khựa nên dân tàu mới yếu như vậy. Mà mấy cái vaccine khác của anh hay đức, dạo gần đây bị bóc phốt là làm giảm sức đề kháng, tăng nguy cơ bị các chứng bệnh khác.

Không có gì là chắc chắn, nên phải cẩn thận, nhưng tuyệt đối không làm cho bản thân và người khác hoang mang.",va mi tham kho bo bbc v new york timesth con virus ny n nguy him hn cm cm bnh thng nhng khng nguy him nh sars covid  hay cc loi virus cm khc  cc quc gia lnh nh tu kha ng c chen chc th bnh n d ly lan hn vi li tu kha n khng c nn y t tt nh chu u hay m v h min dch ca dn tu kha n rt yu nn b qu ti bnh vin l chuyn ng nhin trc ht th khng nn hong s lo lng mt i dch nh l covid  v y l mt loi virus rt ph bin c t rt lu v  c pht hin t tn hi  n sng chung vi loi ngi my thp k ri cc triu chng th vn ging nh cm nh hng nhiu nht l h h hp nhng nu bn ang sng  vit nam mt ni c kh hu cht lng khng kh ti t mi trng sng bn thu v bn ngh rng bn c mt h min dch km th bn nn eo khu trang trnh ni ng ngi nu c th thng xuyn ra tay bng sn phm st khun i khm khi c cc triu chng triu chng th no th chu kh ln mng tham kho c th l do hu covid chch my ci vaccine ca tu kha nn dn tu mi yu nh vy m my ci vaccine khc ca anh hay c do gn y b bc pht l lm gim sc  khng tng nguy c b cc chng bnh khckhng c g l chc chn nn phi cn thn nhng tuyt i khng lm cho bn thn v ngi khc hoang mang,0.9928,1,0.13636363636363635,1

119,"I always really appreciate your updates but I think you may have gotten a few things wrong here

>So...if you're a senior who has had both the Flu and Pneumonia vaccines, you shouldn't be fearing for your life. You're probably going to be okay. 

I’m not sure if you’re trying to say that the pneumococcal (“pneumonia”) vaccines will protect against HMPV pneumonia—it won’t. That vaccine protects against a specific bacterial cause of pneumonia that often occurs secondarily to viral infections but, unfortunately, it doesn’t help with viral infections themselves. 

We also don’t know how effective the flu shot is this season. It’s too early in the Northern Hemisphere season to have usable data but, [per CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7339a1.htm), in the Southern Hemisphere VE was around 35%. Not the greatest even by flu vaccine standards but it’s still always better to get vaccinated than to skip it.

>Kids on the other hand…there is no Pneumonia vaccine for them

Kids under 5 are supposed to get full series of the Hib and pneumococcal vaccines both of which protect against bacteria which are common causes of pneumonia (along with meningitis and sepsis). Again, though, neither of these will protect against pneumonia caused by HMPV",i always really appreciate your updates but i think you may have gotten a few things wrong heresoif youre a senior who has had both the flu and pneumonia vaccines you shouldnt be fearing for your life youre probably going to be okay im not sure if youre trying to say that the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccines will protect against hmpv pneumoniait wont that vaccine protects against a specific bacterial cause of pneumonia that often occurs secondarily to viral infections but unfortunately it doesnt help with viral infections themselves we also dont know how effective the flu shot is this season its too early in the northern hemisphere season to have usable data but per cdc estimates in the southern hemisphere ve was around  not the greatest even by flu vaccine standards but its still always better to get vaccinated than to skip itkids on the other handthere is no pneumonia vaccine for themkids under  are supposed to get full series of the hib and pneumococcal vaccines both of which protect against bacteria which are common causes of pneumonia along with meningitis and sepsis again though neither of these will protect against pneumonia caused by hmpv,-0.9262,-1,0.0671875,0
119,"This amazes me! Why are we not informed about this child pneumonia vaccine in FL? I know it's pretty uniform, so I'm guessing it's our lovely Ladapo, crushing vaccine info as usual. 

Here is the schedule for children under 6 yrs:

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/child-easyread.html

Hasn't vaccination become amazing!? The thing about this is that kids need to see their pediatrician often, and the kids I saw (and their parents) were entirely unaware of the vaccines their kids (under 6) had gotten. Since my Urgent Care no longer had a clinical member that was registered to update vaccine records, we stopped accepting vaccine record cards for kids getting school physicals. 

The fact that kids (hopefully) have been armed with lots of antibodies against Flu and bacterial pneumonia also cheers me - but parents need to be very wary. With kids in daycare it's going to be rough, and parents need to be responsible about spreading illnesses within their toddler's circles.   

You're right. Having a flu shot and pneumonia shot is the same as getting a Covid shot: they are not wholly preventative. Viral pneumonia is a tricky customer. 

But having these shots and *mask wearing* really *does* cut the infection rate, no matter which way you look at it. *Not* getting the Flu (or having a milder infection, teamed up with Tamivir) will spare most seniors from bacterial pneumonia, community spread pneumonia, walking pneumonia, and viral pneumonias like HMPV. 

(Just remember seniors: Going on those care-free maskless cruises will virtually *guarantee* that you come home with *something*.)

You should know that the readers of this subreddit are staunchly aware that mask wearing and proper hand hygiene are the two big tools in our arsenal against catching the viruses that plague us. 

We tend to work in tandem with the r/zerocovidcommunity to keep people aware, and help those with few options protect themselves. 

Very happy to have you here to help. We have very few Pediatricians in this sub, and as you can tell, I am distinctly behind the times. I need to do more research in future posts.

They start off discussing Guardian and NY Times articles which we’re familiar here but around 4 minutes in they mention that a cattle heard was infected in spring and then showed mild symptoms in like November and just kind of brush over the idea that this could have been from infections that weren’t cleared (I’ve had Long Covid since Feb 2020 so that scared me), and they seem to focus their concern on reinfections.

There have really only been minor blurbs on network TV so far from what I’ve seen, it’s not a huge concern but potentially could be under certain circumstances.

IMO, H5N1 is the bigger threat. Not only will you have 1M+ bird culls regularly, but it can infect your dogs and cats and spread to you, and vice versa. It hasn’t developed the ability to jump human to human yet, and there haven’t been cases confirmed outside of people who work directly with sick birds. It’s a when, not an if, it jumps human to human- the question will be how sturdy it is against treatment when it happens.

Sounds like you've then picked up a secondary bacterial pneumonia after a respiratory viral infection, which can happen. Earlier antibiotics wouldn't have been justified.

I ended up in hospital with pneumonia (and ICU with an anaphylactic response to iv antibiotics, but that’s another story).

By withholding information, public health officials and ensured that they lost credibility as the pandemic progressed.

 ""The level of danger is low for the time being, but could change into a deadly pandemic with only a few mutations to the virus.

133,"Agreed. You have identified one of the key problems with the communication from infectious disease scientists to the public and to policymakers. 

In the case of bird flu, the threat remains low, according to official sources. However, evolution is non-linear. It may never go human to human. But if it does, the threat immediately becomes high. 

There will be no “middle threat” level. There should be a way to communicate this. However, policy flows from policy makers which flow from politicians. More and more, politicians are controlled by financial interests exclusively in the short term. If scientists were heeded more generally, this virus likely would have been contained a long time ago. But that would have angered farmers and people that consider egg prices to be the penultimate measure of societal worth. 

The public, for the most part, is not scientifically literate. There are massive risks to causing alarm for something that may not come to fruition. If we had trust in our leaders and/or scientifically literate populations in the UK and the US, a nuanced approach would benefit us all.

Accordingly, pain relief for infants was minimal, often limited to sucrose solutions, even during invasive procedures. Although research in the 1980s began to show that infants have distinct physiological stress responses to pain, many clinicians refused to use it, opting instead for nitrous oxide and muscle relaxing agents that dampen pain rather than block it. Cases such as this one remind us just how much remains unknown, especially in fields involving complex systems like human biology and psychology.

The ""not new"" part is more important than it sounds. Pandemics are usually caused by novel viruses: they are virtually unknown until suddenly exploding in cases. For example, COVID became a pandemic within a span of about 4 months after detection, which happened very shortly after the first animal-human transmission.

Experts are cautioning against panic, and these are the same experts that said COVID could reach pandemic levels back in 2019, so they are not some habitual deniers.",the reason experts keep saying it is not worrisome is because hmpv is not new there has been human transmission for decades since  really and the current uptick does not for now look more serious than a bad flu seasonthe not new part is more important than it sounds pandemics are usually caused by novel viruses they are virtually unknown until suddenly exploding in cases for example covid became a pandemic within a span of about  months after detection which happened very shortly after the first animalhuman transmissionexperts are cautioning against panic and these are the same experts that said covid could reach pandemic levels back in  so they are not some habitual deniers,-0.5312,-1,0.019429590017825325,0

I had believed that it was in fact about 1 in 10 - but the data was admittedly hard to gleen as all the sites kept a running total, rather than data that could be broken down by time frame. 

If I am not mistaken, last I recall, Flu A/B was killing about 1.5 per 100k. And SARS2 (aka Covid-19) was killing roughly 18 per 100k - yes, still much more deadly than Flu A/B. These days verifying the numbers is even more difficult.

At such low numbers, hMPV does not sound like the current culprit in China, as the current mortality rate is about 1 in 3 (from what has been reported). Unless perhaps it has mutated, but we won't know that for a few more months in all likelihood.

In the meantime, ordering more masks seems smart.

A flour that attracts more pollinators is better at reproducing aka that DNA code is better. Pretty much everything we do, language, clothes, society, jobs and everything is just to help our DNA code survive and reproduce. 


In fact our empathy is directly connected to this. We have the most empathy for ourselves, our family, and  friends who are the most likely to share DNA with us. We then care about our community, country, and region who again are more likely to share DNA with us than other regions. Then we usually care about humans more than other creatures (killing a chicken isn't murder). Then we care about mammals or creatures like us more than snakes or frogs. Then we care more about animals than plants generally. Then we care more about large organisms than microorganisms and so on. The more similar a beings DNA is to us the more compassionate we are.

The government can do a lot of things, but that doesn't mean I want it to happen.

Remember, lockdown will cost the government a ton of money, and we are just now recovering from COVID damage. If gov puts a lockdown that means a lot of people are ill, hospitalised or worse dead, and those people can be anyone, your family, friends or even you.

So please be careful what you wish for.

- Bukan virus baru
- Sebagian besar orang memiliki kekebalan: Kebanyakan orang, terutama anak-anak, telah terinfeksi HMPV sebelum usia 10 tahun, sehingga memiliki kekebalan terhadap virus ini. Kekebalan ini membuat infeksi ulang cenderung lebih ringan.
- Tingkat kematian rendah: Meskipun HMPV dapat menyebabkan penyakit parah pada kelompok rentan, tingkat kematiannya secara umum rendah. Berbeda dengan COVID-19 yang memiliki tingkat kematian yang signifikan, terutama pada awal pandemi.
- Penyebaran tidak secepat COVID-19
- Gejala umumnya ringan

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world.",hey mate lets exclude this indian media fiasco i have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topicthe hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the  year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres china and malaysia hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strainkeeping that in mind hmpv has a lower ro value than covid   and the delta variant had  ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected personthe syptoms of hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital the incubation period of hmpv is less than covid and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for  to  days hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk it can get uglier if not treated the suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in hmpv cases note not once in  years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous note when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and who is pating so much attention it just cant happen with indian media and the first death reported in india due to covid was mad in th march  when a novel took this much time in  billion people country  please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past for now wait for the official report made by who and cdc that will decide the future of this world,-0.9499,-1,-0.0603292181069959,0
173,"Here's a preview of the story: 

Indian officials have confirmed the vast nation's first cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with seven people said to have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.

Medical News: Surge in Cases Raises Concerns
China has been grappling with a marked increase in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections and related hospitalizations since mid-December 2024.

Reports from various provinces indicate a steady rise in cases, creating apprehension about the possibility of a novel viral outbreak. However, health officials have emphasized that HMPV is not a new virus but a relatively under-recognized respiratory pathogen.

  Experts have pointed out that HMPV is often overshadowed by more widely known respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). This Medical News report aims to provide a detailed and accessible explanation of the situation, delving into the latest developments and their implications.

  Spotlight on New HMPV Lineages
Researchers in China have recently identified new lineages of HMPV belonging to subtype A2. These lineages reportedly exhibit significant mutations in three key proteins, raising questions about their potential impact on disease severity and transmission.

While detailed data has not yet been made public, early findings have prompted a closer investigation. Some scientists have speculated that these mutations could make the virus more neurotrophic, meaning it may have a higher likelihood of affecting the nervous system.

  Also, many local media reports are mentioning about infected individuals feeling a sense of dizziness and also cognitive issues, and also cases of children and the elderly being admitted due to encephalitis are all  indirectly validating that the new HMPV lineages could be more neurotrophic after all.

  Domestic media outlets have noted that many individuals with HMPV infections are experiencing flu-like symptoms, such as dizziness, persistent cough, and fatigue. However, experts caution that these symptoms are non-specific and overlap significantly with those of other respiratory illnesses.

  A Familiar but Often Overlooked Threat
HMPV is not a new pathogen. Discovered in 2001, it has been circulating globally for over six decades, causing infections across all age groups. According to Zheng Lishu, a virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus typically causes mild symptoms that resolve within a week. However, i t can lead to severe complications in vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

  Ruan Zhengshang, an infectious disease expert at Xinhua Hospital in Shanghai, has advised the public not to self-diagnose based on symptoms alone. “It is not accurate to differentiate between influenza, HMPV, and other respiratory infections based on the severity of fever or dizziness,” he explained. Instead, he urged individuals with worsening symptoms to seek professional medical evaluation.

  Challenges in Diagnosis
Unlike influenza or COVID-19, HMPV does not yet have widely available rapid diagnostic tests. Laboratory testing, while accurate, is both expensive and time-consuming, posing a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, many cases may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed as other respiratory illnesses.

  Managing and Preventing Infections
Tang Lanfang, a pediatric respiratory specialist from Children’s Hospital at Zhejiang University, has highlighted the need for vigilance among parents and caregivers. Severe cases of HMPV can lead to pneumonia, especially in children. Symptoms such as persistent high fever, worsening cough, lethargy, and shortness of breath should prompt immediate medical attention.

  Currently, there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for HMPV. Management focuses on supportive care, including adequate rest, hydration, and symptom relief. Preventive measures are crucial and include wearing masks, frequent hand washing, ensuring proper ventilation, and avoiding crowded spaces - guidelines echoed by both Chinese and international health authorities.

  Concluding Thoughts
The ongoing rise in HMPV infections in China underscores the need for heightened awareness and continued research. The emergence of new lineages within subtype A2 raises important questions about the virus’s behavior and its potential implications for public health. While most cases remain mild, the risk to vulnerable groups highlights the importance of prevention and timely medical intervention.

The CDC further said ""In susceptible individuals with underlying medical conditions, HMPV infection can lead to death.

HMPV infections can cause severe and even fatal disease in immunocompromised patients 2, 3, with crude reported mortality rates from HMPV pneumonia ranging from 10% to 80% in different small cohort studies of cancer and/or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients 3, 4, 5, 6.",idk where did u get that information seemingly false heres what our dear googlu has to sayhmpv often causes common cold symptoms manifested as cough fever nasal congestion and wheezing but sometimes it can result in bronchitis and pneumonia in severe cases said chinas cdc the cdc further said in susceptible individuals with underlying medical conditions hmpv infection can lead to deathhmpv infections can cause severe and even fatal disease in immunocompromised patients   with crude reported mortality rates from hmpv pneumonia ranging from  to  in different small cohort studies of cancer andor hematopoietic cell transplantation hct patients,-0.9753,-1,-0.28125,-1

There are fears that human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is spreading further across Asia after two sick babies were hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus in India.

China earlier revealed it has been grappling with a spike of patients suffering from the flu-like respiratory infection caused by the virus this winter. The surge in cases—which seems to have particularly affected children—has swept across northern China, but the country has played down fears of another Covid-style pandemic, with politicians noting that such illnesses are common during the winter months.

The authors stated in their results, something that is nothing short of amazing. “It was apparent very early that this individual was more or less unreliable and from the start it was possible to keep him in the dark regarding our procedure. He had inconspicuous symptoms after his test injection of sterile broth and no more striking results from the cold filtrate, until an assistant, on the second day after injection, inadvertently referred to this failure to contract a cold. That evening and night the subject reported severe symptomatology, including sneezing, cough, sore throat and stuffiness in the nose.

1. The ""biochemistry chain"" is the exact same process a cell uses to build any protein. Viral mRNA gets into the cell via virion. Said mRNA gets introduced to the ribosomes. Ribosomes build viral proteins. Viral proteins assemble into full virion. The process repeats until the cell bursts and dies which causes cellular damage and answers your question about why a replicating virus causes damage.

196,"Your 'proof' is utterly absurd, squirting a cocktail of chemicals into the nose at various doses and some people getting ill is no proof of viral transmission. It is simply proof that the body can handle certain amounts of poison/toxins/noxious chemicals, but when the load is too high it will attempt to stop further exposure (making you feel like shit so that you rest) and attempt to flush the area where foreign matter was detected. 

Also transmission requires both a sender and a receiver. 

LoL at household transmission. The very same metric can be used to prove that obesity is a transmitted virus. 

You are dodging the fact that we are lead to believe that passing an infected stranger, or sitting near someone on a train for a few minutes can (and will) lead to becoming infected by them. 

Despite the absolutely abundant instances of people having flu we still require them to come to a lab and have a 'virus' squirted directly into their nose (and with the 'viral load' being high enough) before we can prove transmission? How many times have you had someone sneeze directly into your nose? Maybe you walk around with a snorkel ready to catch someone's expulsions? (obviously the tube bit goes up your nose)

You know this brings up something I've noticed among germ theory deniers/terrain theory supporters. Not once can they name a single specific toxin/chemical/poison/negative emotion/etc that has been shown to cause the flu, Ebola, rabies, plague, tuberculosis, etc.  In fact no one even gives advice on how to *avoid* them. The only thing said is to let your body kill itself as it ""detoxifies"" itself of these unknown nebulous toxins.  Why suffer if you can easily avoid the toxin or whatever that's responsible for causing your ailments. And this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface that is the abysmal failure of terrain theory to explain why common causes don't cause rare events at a more common occurrence. As an example I've seen rabies be blamed on malnutrition/famine (after much poking and questioning done). Over a billion people across the planet are malnourished and rabies only has ~56,000 cases per year with the majority focused in India. No terrain theory supporter can explain this massive discrepancy.",your proof is utterly absurd squirting a cocktail of chemicals into the nose at various doses and some people getting ill is no proof of viral transmission it is simply proof that the body can handle certain amounts of poisontoxinsnoxious chemicals but when the load is too high it will attempt to stop further exposure making you feel like shit so that you rest and attempt to flush the area where foreign matter was detected you know this brings up something ive noticed among germ theory deniersterrain theory supporters not once can they name a single specific toxinchemicalpoisonnegative emotionetc that has been shown to cause the flu ebola rabies plague tuberculosis etc  in fact no one even gives advice on how to avoid them the only thing said is to let your body kill itself as it detoxifies itself of these unknown nebulous toxins  why suffer if you can easily avoid the toxin or whatever thats responsible for causing your ailments and this doesnt even begin to scratch the surface that is the abysmal failure of terrain theory to explain why common causes dont cause rare events at a more common occurrence as an example ive seen rabies be blamed on malnutritionfamine after much poking and questioning done over a billion people across the planet are malnourished and rabies only has  cases per year with the majority focused in india no terrain theory supporter can explain this massive discrepancy,-0.9806,-1,-0.017629399585921326,0

If I eat shop bought vegetables can I avoid them using heavy-metal-based insecticides? No. 

Can I avoid pollution if I walk around a city? No. 

Can I avoid stress? No. 

Can I avoid cold dreary weather (without moving country)? No. 

Personally I would question whether a known chemical/element causes symptoms similar to a particular disease. For example Polio and heavy metal poisoning (look at spinal lesions if you are actually interested). Small pox and serious malnutrition coupled with severe bedbug infestation (and subsequent bug fecal matter composition). The most recent ebola incident that I am aware of was said to be due to a tainted malaria vaccine which affected aid workers. (special mention of tainted vaccines goes to Bill Gates and his Polio vaccine in India). Other than that the ebola virus only seems to be present in African countries where I am sure they don't have the best safety standards for chemical fertilisers and the like. 

My personal belief is that both flu and colds are not viruses but are just a general bodily warning system. Each person has their own personal threshold for the amount of nasties their body can easily vanquish (based on age, fitness, diet etc). If the body becomes slightly overwhelmed (or doesn't understand why its temperature has fluctuated so much in a short space of time - see current UK weather change over the past week or two) it brings about the symptoms associated with having a cold to force you to take it easy and not increase the strain. If further nasties are added (or a greater hit of nasties in one go) the body tries to limit activity and promote rest which results in flu symptoms. If you want to test this theory I would suggest that you ingest large amounts of nasties in the form of alcohol. You will notice that the majority of hangover symptoms are the exact same as flu symptoms. Albeit with vomiting replacing nasal discharge due to the method of consumption of said nasties. 

As for your rabies bit, personally I would look up what else causes light/water aversion and foaming at the mouth, taking a look at the composition of the saliva of canines in particular as this seems to be the source of transmission. So, it would be something that is present in the dog and being released into the saliva.

“Immunity from H1N1 influenza typically lasts for a couple of years, with antibody levels gradually declining over time, meaning you may need to get vaccinated again periodically to maintain protection; however, the exact duration can vary depending on individual immune response and the specific strain of H1N1 involved. 

**Key points about H1N1 immunity:**

**Short-term protection:**
After a natural infection or vaccination, initial immunity against H1N1 is strong but gradually wanes within a few years. 

**Flu strain variations:**
Because influenza viruses can mutate, immunity against one H1N1 strain might not fully protect against newer variants.”

233,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country .

242,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world.",hey mate lets exclude this indian media fiasco i have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topicthe hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the  year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres china and malaysia hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strainkeeping that in mind hmpv has a lower ro value than covid   and the delta variant had  ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected personthe syptoms of hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital the incubation period of hmpv is less than covid and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for  to  days hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk it can get uglier if not treated the suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in hmpv cases note not once in  years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous note when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and who is pating so much attention it just cant happen with indian media and the first death reported in india due to covid was mad in th march  when a novel took this much time in  billion people country  please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past for now wait for the official report made by who and cdc that will decide the future of this world,-0.9499,-1,-0.0603292181069959,0
242,"Here's a preview of the story: 

Indian officials have confirmed the vast nation's first cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with seven people said to have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.

245,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world.",hey mate lets exclude this indian media fiasco i have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topicthe hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the  year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres china and malaysia hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strainkeeping that in mind hmpv has a lower ro value than covid   and the delta variant had  ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected personthe syptoms of hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital the incubation period of hmpv is less than covid and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for  to  days hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk it can get uglier if not treated the suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in hmpv cases note not once in  years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous note when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and who is pating so much attention it just cant happen with indian media and the first death reported in india due to covid was mad in th march  when a novel took this much time in  billion people country  please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past for now wait for the official report made by who and cdc that will decide the future of this world,-0.9499,-1,-0.0603292181069959,0

COVID is an abbreviation for **CO**rona**VI**rus **D**isease. It is not a genus and has nothing to do with scientific nomenclature. It was a convenient name to use so people didn't keep panicking whenever the acronym SARS came up. COVID-19 was caused by *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* (so the genus is *Betacoronavirus*), which is the same species which caused SARS in 2001.

Forcing us to get all scientific here rams the point home. *Human metapneumovirus* is a species isolated in 2001. *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* is a species which caused an epidemic in 2001. Yes, they both already have existed in humans for some time, that doesn't mean new variants don't appear (as the new variant which caused COVID-19 suddenly appeared). Nobody is saying it has, or will, but aren't we being a bit obtuse to pretend there's nothing familiar about a species of virus from 2001 suddenly spreading out of control in China after we JUST got over a pandemic caused by another species of virus from 2001 spreading out of control in China?

The triad of low oxygen plus fast respiratory rate plus fatigue/increased work of breathing is what comes before they drop off that cliff. Unfortunately, kids are NOT adults; they exhaust their reserve without many signs that the collapse is immanent. You can't wait until they ""look worse."" This is what they look like when they are in crisis.

Please let them take her to the hospital in the ambulance. Honestly, although triage shouldn't work this way, it may make it even an inch more likely to get the last bed there. The last night I was on call, I spent the next day pulling together the direct line numbers for ""transfer centers"" (or the equivalent) for children's hospitals in the surrounding seven states.

I'd had to call four children's hospitals before I could find one for transfer. Well, one of them would have taken her, but there was a 24 hour wait expected -- and we don't have kid-sized ventilators here. The last time I saw one like this, we did intubate and just tried our best while awaiting transport.

Children's hospitals are in crisis. This is our version of the 2019 surge. RSV and flu are hitting hard, and COVID is still there, but it's the secondary pneumonias that are doing them in. Check out the nursing subreddit. Nurses without experience in pediatrics are being pulled in, including to NICUs and PICUs.

The hospital will work with you. There is some specific language to use when asking for aid if you are in that hole between Medicaid and being able to pay. We will help you. Please get her safe.

There is no safe option other than the ambulance ride with the oxygen mask.

If not, ask about applying for charity care/bill forgiveness through the hospital. This option will take perseverance, but there are organizations that can help you advocate for yourself if you get a bill that seems unfair.

255,"The following is not my comment but I saw it elsewhere on Reddit today. Sorry, I don’t have the redditor’s name. 

Hey sweetie I negotiate hospital bills for a living. I want to let you know that what you’re feeling is normal, but only because people don’t understand how not serious this is. So take a few deep breaths and let me explain…

Insurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf. We frequently gets these bills reduced by 40, 50, 60%. This has caused providers to pad their bills, knowing they will only receive a small portion. That, plus all the uninsured folks who never pay, means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic services.

You do not have to pay this bill. Ever. They can’t do anything to you. No one will force you. It will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt. This is America. Literally everyone has medical debt. It won’t stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house. It doesn’t make a difference.

In a few years, the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar. Then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times, trying to settle with you. At this point, if you want to settle, offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full. They will likely take it.

If you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you’re making the payments, it won’t get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).

Please don’t do anything drastic. The system is fucked and it’s supposed to make you scared and nervous so that you sell your baby to pay the bills. In the end, the hospital knows they have no leverage against you so they want to make everything complicated and intimidating. Don’t let them win.

255,"NAD but have bronchial asthma (basically asthma that kicks in when I’m sick), and it runs in my family - my brother does have full blown asthma. 

I can’t give solid advice like doctors on here, but I can tell you that if it stays in that low range (90 or under for longer than a few hours): A) you need to be treating him with the albuterol nebulizer machine as prescribed to open up his airways - do you have a nebulizer machine at home? It’s a must for anyone with asthma. B) if the nebulizer isn’t bringing up his numbers, or if you don’t have a nebulizer and his numbers stay that low for a while, it’s best to take him in. Reason for this is that his low blood oxygen is depriving his tissues and organs of necessary oxygen to sustain themself; meaning long term can have bad consequences.

264,"whilst the virus is said to not be ""new"", let's not forget viruses constantly mutate, it may not have been a big deal when it first showed up but it can mutate and get stronger and more infectious.

Speaking from personal experience (i'm in SEA), this virus hit me HARD. i think my immune system was already compromised from having COVID before, but i got sick from HMPV twice over the last 2 months.  
All it took was for someone to sneeze or cough near me,and i was out for 2 weeks. I've never been sick like this before.   
it starts with a sore throat then deep. uncontrollable coughing and spitting up phlegm for a week. the coughing literally HURTS.Breathing HURTS because your lungs and airways are so raw and sore from the coughing fits.  Couldn't breathe through my nose either because the nasal passages were congested, basically couldn't sleep for a few nights because of this. My Dr finally caved and gave me steroids and antibiotics after a week, which helped speed up the recovery.   
\*\*THERE IS NO MEDICATION FOR HMPV.\*\*  
All the doctors can do is just give you medication to relieve the coughing and phlegm, but it doesn't kill the virus. Its a rough and long ride to recovery if you get infected.  
  
With COVID, all i had was nausea and fever, and just couldn't get out of bed for a few days because i was so tired. All i had to do was take panadol and just sleep to get better.

I wouldn't wish HMPV on anyone. News/media/governments aren't talking about this because they can't risk another risk worldwide panic and everything shutting down and messing up the economy anymore.Just practice good personal hygiene, i would just play it safe and mask up if you go anywhere indoors or where it's crowded. and best to isolate yourself when you start feeling symptoms. it starts out feeling like a common flu but its very contagious and it takes a long time to get well.",whilst the virus is said to not be new lets not forget viruses constantly mutate it may not have been a big deal when it first showed up but it can mutate and get stronger and more infectiousspeaking from personal experience im in sea this virus hit me hard i think my immune system was already compromised from having covid before but i got sick from hmpv twice over the last  months  all it took was for someone to sneeze or cough near meand i was out for  weeks ive never been sick like this before   it starts with a sore throat then deep uncontrollable coughing and spitting up phlegm for a week the coughing literally hurtsbreathing hurts because your lungs and airways are so raw and sore from the coughing fits  couldnt breathe through my nose either because the nasal passages were congested basically couldnt sleep for a few nights because of this my dr finally caved and gave me steroids and antibiotics after a week which helped speed up the recovery   there is no medication for hmpv  all the doctors can do is just give you medication to relieve the coughing and phlegm but it doesnt kill the virus its a rough and long ride to recovery if you get infected    with covid all i had was nausea and fever and just couldnt get out of bed for a few days because i was so tired all i had to do was take panadol and just sleep to get betteri wouldnt wish hmpv on anyone newsmediagovernments arent talking about this because they cant risk another risk worldwide panic and everything shutting down and messing up the economy anymorejust practice good personal hygiene i would just play it safe and mask up if you go anywhere indoors or where its crowded and best to isolate yourself when you start feeling symptoms it starts out feeling like a common flu but its very contagious and it takes a long time to get well,-0.5878,-1,-0.0007481201925646317,0
