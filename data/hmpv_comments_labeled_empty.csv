0,Wait first let me buy a gaming laptop so that I can spend my time in lockdown well.
1,I dont even care anymore at this rate just kill me
2,"I’m a Pediatric Pulmonary RN. This is NOT a new virus. This is already very well established in the US. From Wikipedia:

“As of 2016, it was the second most common cause (after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) of acute respiratory tract illness in otherwise-healthy children under the age of 5 in a large US outpatient clinic.[3]”

We’ve already reached some sort of equilibrium with this virus in our population. China is just having a local epidemic. Which is different from a pandemic. I know everyone’s still a bit traumatized by Covid 19, but this is not equivalent. Please, stop spreading unfounded fear."

We got something else on our minds"
4,"""new"""
5,"Being lockdown with GTA 6, Damn."
6,![gif](giphy|p7ESzgUi7li93Hxjte|downsized)
7,Because it’s not fucking new
8,"Bro what.... this virus has been identified in 2001. Its not a new virus at all. Perhaps there was the first significant number of infections more recently, but we're all pretending this is something new that doctors have never seen before like covid"
9,"Oh you want me to take another multi-month staycation to play videogames for 16 hours a day?

Say it ain't so"
10,Not new and didn't start in China
11,"Not again bro, The pandemic took years of my 20s"
12,"Tbh, I kinda enjoyed the covid years."
13,"""The clinical features and severity of HMPV are similar to those of RSV""

So yes, it is a joke."
14,Is coffin dance coming back though?
15,It isn't a new virus. Jesus fucking Christ social media really sucks nowadays
16,Why be afraid when you can embrace the sweet release of death?
17,No way we got pandemic s2 before gta6
18,That's what happens when people can't catch a break. Life's been so bad lately I wouldn't mind a virus hitting me at this point.
19,"God, Bro just gave up and go play rebel inc instead, you suck ass at plague inc"
20,"HMPV is nothing. Like a cold, lasts 2-5 days, and goes away on its own. It is not something to be concerned with."
21,The sad stuff about this is most 'internet people' actually miss the pandemic and lockdown. And they would be happy if it happens again.
22,This virus is not new and was first identified in 2001 in the Netherlands.
23,"Every few years there is a new virus that will supposedly cause a pandemic, but only one did so far"
24,"I mean yeah, it's the internet of course we'll make memes.

And NGL even if the virus spread around it ain't reaching covid levels, people and companies and governments are significantly more used to dealing with lockdowns."
25,"Aww shit, here we go again"
26,Hmpv isn't new
27,![gif](giphy|j6ZlX8ghxNFRknObVk|downsized)
28,We didn't learn anything from covid
29,"Yes, it is a bloody joke."
30,This virus comes from people with doo doo breath
31,"It’s not a new virus 

That’s why you have a name for it. HMPV. Bc it’s not new."
32,The fuck do you want me to do?
33,"Yes, yes you are a joke to me, because you are a mere common little pshetic virus

I am laughing"
34,"Why should we be afraid? It's a common cold and even experts say not to bother worrying about it. Its effects are known to mostly be mild.

Covid was borderline worth the lockdowns it caused; it really was quite lethal in people of poor health and the elderly, and also seemed to randomly be more deadly in healthy people. With that said, I think many people agree now that we may have gone abit far after not reacting quickly enough to quell it before it really got going.

The media is just causing panic, again, for clicks. It's highly unethical and should be against journalistic integrity. But, I guess that integrity went out the window when 24/7 media became a thing."
35,"Chill 2120 is far away, and as we know all big plague outbreaks happen once every 100 years(1720 plague, 1820 cholera, 1920 bird flu, 2020 covid)"
36,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on meme, fool me thrice... uhhh crap, gna need more meme ideas"
37,Not again. Not doing this a second time...
38,"And what are we going to do about it? We have an administration coming in that doesn’t believe in inoculating against health threats. A president who espoused drinking bleach, and trying to illuminate our interiors to kill coronavirus. What a tool. He’s going to take us out of the World Health Organization and cut us off from the rest of the world because that’s what fascists do. 15 million voters didn’t come out in support of a Democratic candidate. But they do support this clown show."
39,"We need to meme every virus going forward. Less we want to be under a 2 week, years long lock down again. Some of you may die. But that's a risk I'm willing to take."
40,"Aren't the risks of a pandemic in both cases (H5N1 and HMPV) low? H5N1 needs a mutation for human-human transmission and countries are already stockpiling vaccines just in case, and HMPV isn't nearly as lethal as Covid and usually mild in healthy adults (which doesn't mean it's not a threat, but compared to how many regular adults were knocked out due to covid its a good sign)."
41,Gotta admit the covid lockdown was one of my favourite times.. xd
42,I blame the same president that was in office during our 2020 lockdown
43,"This meme has big 2020 energy

We're screwed"
44,Anyone got any bleach left over from Covid? We can just inject that right? Maybe drink it this time?
45,Atleast this time people might listen and not die
46,lol I chuckled
47,"I thought it was just one of those viruses that are already go around during this time of year. The Flu and common cold aren't the only common sicknesses.


Maybe I'm thinking of something else, but I didn't think it was a new virus."
48,Hell naw. This is MY pandemic. All y’all got to lockdown and have fun while we still had to work and keep the city running. This time you guys work and we get to lock down for 2 weeks.
49,😂😂😂
50,We already had that one. It was called COVID.
51,Dude hmpv is a weak virus that causes cold-like symptoms. Stop fear mongering.
52,Again?
53,"I didn't know they are making pandemic season 2
What's the time release though?"
54,"New pandemic my ass, remember Monkeypox? Everyone was talking about it during August to September period, and then everyone forgot."

56,"The world rn: ""I GUESS HISTORY ISN'T HAPPENING HARD ENOUGH FOR YOU TO LEARN FROM IT!"""
57,Essential worker pay and stimmy checks lez goooo
58,Sometimes I miss early 2020 when things seemed like we wouldnt get out again. Everything slowed down. All the boys were always online. It was a great time for gamers.
59,"""How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man!"""
60,It's gallows humor.
61,H1N1 spread out in USA a few month ago? Avian flu and others?
62,"the neural net is broke...

its scrambling"
63,"![gif](giphy|b6GZTb2n25pl716ZMZ|downsized)

I'm all in"
64,Aew we gonna get a second lock down before GTA6?
65,There's a zero percent chance people are complying with a 2nd round of lockdowns 😂
66,China is in the middle of a cold and harsh winter so there’s obviously plenty of people getting sick at the same time and this ain’t a new virus either so don’t freak out just yet.
67,Getting afraid weakens your immune system
68,Well I’ve already had two close brushes with death recently so nah I’d win
69,Time to get that sweet pandemic paycheck
70,Afraid of what? Being locked up? Dying? We are already past that.
71,What's going on in China??
72,"Remember when people were saying COVID was just like the flu? (Spoiler: it wasn't)

This is like that, except it actually is just like a bad flu."
73,Wfh brotha ... the bump in internet usage is gonna be a boon for tech jobs as well
74,And thus balance has been restored
75,Why is it china again? I thought india was next

My partner kept telling me I was way worse than I thought, and now I have to listen to her in the future lol."
77,"Liverpool favorites for winning the league, it all makes sense now"
78,not even a new virus
79,"Just let it go. I will sacrifice myself to this virus. Almost died from covid, might try again as well.
Maybe some corpo rich bastards will also perish."
80,Season 2?

82,Oh goody- I was wondering what the bio-terror manufacturers have been up to after their big hit.
83,The world is so unserious now that if a deadly asteroid was heading towards earth we’d make memes about it as well
84,It's basically the flu.
85,"Please, it's bird flu we have to worry about now, not HMPV."
86,Yes virus. Yes you are a joke to me
87,"Hey wait, I saw this about 5 years ago, and everyone shrugged and said it wasn't china's fault."
88,"i might get downvoted or smth for this, but people always say india is so unhygienic when covid, hmpv, sars, etc viruses all originated from china and nobody says anything about that. nothing against china, just doesn’t make much sense"
89,Back to wanking and gaming all day woo hoo !!!
90,Lock down the world and sink the global economic system over whats a basically a cold and good luck getting the public to trust you again. Classic boy who cried wolf
91,"I'm watching you, Wazowski."

Only until you kill me."
93,"Covid was an overblown scam. Why would we fall for that shit twice? Unvaxxed and unfazed, baby!"
94,Not again
95,Mike washouskey
96,"It's just right wingers pumping up the propaganda to try to get people to overreact so in 2 years they can go ""wow those people are dumb""."
97,"""i've play this game before""😭😭"
98,You realize almost all recent viral threats have been in some way experimented with gain of function in a lab setting before infecting outside the lab? It’s intentional.
99,"No need to worry guys . It was first discovered in 2001 , it's not a new virus which came into existence. But one thing ,there is no vaccine for HMPV 💀"

115,I WILL NEVER FORGIVE THE JAPANESE
116,"Interesting fact, research if being conducted on mirrored forms of life that outgrow and live normal bacteria and viruses and can be neither digested or affected by normal animal systems like our own immune system and has the potential to lead to an actual extinction and not a single person but the people doing the research on them care."
117,I have it right now it kinda sucked painful cough but over it in 3 days

131,"That's part of the psyop. 


Americans showed the world who (which demographics) you should target if you want your virus to spread quickly.

151,HMPV is literally just the common cold...
152,"This is a 20yr old virus that has peaked in previous years, simlar to RSV.  Panic is new, the virus is not."

159,"Yes, common cold, you are a joke"
160,Maybe it's because COVID was a big joke.
161,It's not a new virus. The fact we already know what it is would indicate it's not exactly new.
162,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice…."
163,I mean being afraid does nothing. Atleast making memes makes us laugh 🤷🏽‍♂️
164,There is definitely a fear campaign going on to make people extremely nervous about this virus for no reason. People need to pay attention. This is not a new virus.
165,"Yeah nobody is gunna fall for it again. Everyone remembers how governments tried to spin that into total dictatorship. 

A lot of people are going to die questioning the legitimacy of diseases for generations because of the damage done by that."
166,What if the life we live now is the virus 🤔
167,"Remember, if the media starts fearmongering, it's trivial in reality.


If the media starts saying it definitely isn't a big deal, * that's * when you start worrying."
168,Every winter.
169,stop eating authentic shit!
170,Can we get zombies this time 🥹
171,"Viruses and shit suck.  But people need to chill.  Eat properly(chicken noodles soup and plenty of liquids), get rest, etc.  Unless youre unhealthy, most people can survive shit that's not outright AIDS."
172,"Being afraid won't help anything, all we can do is wait and see. Gallows humor is a natural response to feeling powerless and coping with difficult situations."
173,"Yeah it is a joke at this point we haven't nuked China over the viral attack they perpetrated against the rest of the world in 2020.  And now another pandemic is upon us and where has it started? Oh China again?  HEY CHINA!!! Put the cute little vial down, you obviously will never know what you are doing, and there's no point in trying anymore go back to making cheap junk that will be thrown in the garbage heap in a week.  You were better at that."

183,What does being afraid serve anyone? Show no fear. Fear is useless.
184,Hahahha @eightpancakes you would block me cause you're a complete fucking idiot. Here's my reply since you blocked me. I dont think your life is though that's why you sit on your keyboard talking shit on reddit. Judging by your comments that's all you do is troll to make yourself feel better. Sad sad existence. Bet you can't even afford a house let alone a car in the uk. You probably still live with your mum in her flat because you're still jerking it to fucking pics of the queen.

303,Again?? And in China as well. Oh come on 😭 We just barely recovered from covid bruh.
304,I didn’t fall for it in 2019 and I am not going to fall for it now.
305,"Relax...
HMPV is not new and not life-threatening when treated correctly. It's the second most common cause of respiratory problems for about 10 years now."

315,It ain't started in china bro. It already existed since 2002. It's just exploded in china recently. Doesn't mean it's from china or started in china.
316,And I learn of this through a meme post on Reddit??
317,"HMPV isn't new, and the infection rates are increasing alongside other respiratory viruses, as you would expect to see during winter, everything is normal."
318,"Yes, anything the news says to be afraid of is a joke to me."
319,Isn't that what happened to C19 too? IIRC we were mocking it up until locmdowns
320,Hopefully lockdown 2 will happen.

345,Facts make it hard to hate Chinese people for fake internet points though
346,"Tbf the Coronavirus wasn't new either, actually none of them are. Viruses have been around longer than we have. What matters is their mutations."
347,What about the H5N1? Any news on that one?
348,[deleted]
349,Thanks. Came here to say this.
350,"I was about to say lol, HMPV ain't new."
351,"Came here to re-re-re-re-post this fact but glad to see someone beat me to it. Now, off to Facebook to see how much toilet paper I need to hoard due to the coming plague manufactured in China by Soros-backed illegal immigrants. God I'm so tired of this timeline."
352,">is NOT a new virus

We've had seasonal coronavirus for decades as well, rsv, rhino virus, ev, and influenza. 

It's when a strain decides to be all Novel and strain of interest that things get spicy. 

We have annual flu seasons, and it's pretty standard fair - and then we get exciting years like 1918."
353,Upvote this. Downvote the post. Misinformation or at least dramatizing unnecessarily needs to stop.
354,"I did read slightly about the chinese case.

They have more automatic testing when it comes to flu. As we know, these viruses infect people to people so they, unsurprisingly, find some virus is infecting more than some others. And yes it happens more in every country in winter, what a shocker. But it all comes down to their testing. We don't do these tests, so it's just a ""flu"" in western countries.

Also they have less cases than last year. 

All a big nothing burger."
355,Came here to say this.
356,I had HMPV right before Covid hit. I am a first responder so it was priming me for the next 2 or 3 bouts with Covid that I inevitably caught while on the job.
357,"It alternates every few years with PIV and enterovirus, showing up more often than others alongside flu and rsv. 

They're all mostly nothing to write home about, causing mostly just a cold. Tho I still remember that year we had a wave of enterovirus start early and then saw an uptick in linked GBS 

I think people have just discovered that there are, in fact, other respiratory viruses other than flu and """"the common cold"""" and look out for it more often now. 

I have just told my friends to stop asking if x respiratory virus in the news that weeks is gonna be the ""next covid"" 

I'm still not sure people even realise coronaviruses aren't new, but it's not a discussion I want to have. Last coronavirus pandemic, pre cov19, was a lil over 100  years ago and is the same class as SARS, MERS, and COV so it's annoyed me from the start they just gave covid a whole ass new name. It's a beta coronavirus, and the last coronavirus to cause a pandemic is, in fact, still in circulation today and showed up every year during winter months alongside three other seasonal coronaviruses and tens of other super common seasonal respiratory viruses 

Idky I even engaged in this post 😂"
358,Can we signal boost this please? I feel a lot more people need to hear it.
359,"Ayo mods, pin this post right here"
360,"Thank you for being a rational voice. My now two and a half year old son caught HMPV when he was six months old. It was scary and awful as a parent, but the ER doctor was fairly unconcerned and not surprised to find a daycare kid had contracted HMPV."
361,"It feels like every year or so there is a spike in fear over some ""new"" disease. Even way before COVID. There was zika, ebola, etc. and it rarely turns into anything serious. I even ignored covid until it really started to spike in late February and March. Wish they'd stop sensationalizing new diseases so real threats stand out more"
362,People spreading unfounded fear is purposeful. They do not care if it is true. Disinformation was king during Covid and at least in America a chunk of the population are rejecting reality and science along with it.
363,"Thank you, came to say this. It’s been a thing since 2001. I had a patient the other day with it at my hospital. Similar to a cold, I was told. Patient was elderly and it didn’t seem to negatively affect her too much and she wasn’t in good shape to begin with. All before this “pandemic” talk started happening."
364,The WHO said that the increase in infections (along with several other respiratory viruses) are what they'd expect to see during the winter.
365,Three days late but I think it’s important to mention that this is purely anti-Chinese sentiment/Sinophobia. The reason we’re hearing about this is because in China they have a more effective disease surveillance system than in America - the reason people won’t shut up about it is because both sides in America benefit from spreading anti-Chinese sentiment
366,"It could be a mutation, and global pandemics usually are local first."
367,So was Corona Virus. It was a common cause for common cold after rhinovirus and some other viruses. but mutations made it hard to control. Same thing could be going on with this one too.

372,For real. My daughter had human metapneumovirus a couple years ago. We live in the US. It’s similar to RSV or a severe cold
373,"Don't worry. This virus has been in the US and Europe for years. It's basically just any other respiratory virus. If you're not old, young, or immunocompromised, you'll be fine, which is the same with common flus and colds.

Chances are the western world has had a bunch of cases this winter and no one has tested because cases just look like regular flus or colds. This isn't that big a deal."
374,I really wish we get into another pandemic. I hate socializing with people

376,"Because they’re losers, and like it when it’s societally acceptable to behave in the same pathetic ways as they do."
377,"My iPhone’s affordability, which is good enough for me."
378,"Well, in this case, they're not contributing a new virus & OP & everyone believing him are idiots. This virus has been identified for well over 20 years."
379,This virus was first identified in the Netherlands. This is a European virus.
380,Wouldn’t surprise me if people already buying 200 rolls and plenty of handwash.
381,Well if I spend my time at home gaming all day and not getting out then sure I'll be safe
382,"Yeah, COVID wasn't as bad as it could be because it had like a 1% mortality rate. If something hits with a 10% mortality rate, or 20%, it won't be a nice isolation like it was during COVID, it'll be more like the movie Contagion."

Frankly either option works"
386,That’s right they go anywhere even the comfort of your own bedroom
387,"It's about having the right tool for the job.

Hardcore gamer who wants the full experience with great cost effectiveness? Tower PC.

Casual gamer who wants the comfort of carrying the thing anywhere, be it the sofa in their home or to their friend's place, and doesn't mind the concessions that come with that? Laptop's just fine.

I'm the former category but I can absolutely see the merits of the latter."
388,And a pretty weak old virus at that. Just mild cold-like symptoms. The internet can be a silly place sometimes.
389,And yeah I need good internet also and i should get paid monthly while at home
390,They'd accept a lazy ass like me?

You can ofcourse get pretty sick from it, and i believe its particularly a bad one for young kids, but there's established treatments for it that still work. Or work as well as they've always done, no treatment is ever a guarantee ofcourse"
405,I don't hate socializing with people but the pandemic times were good to me.
406,I have this thought every time I get stuck in traffic
407,The only 2 times I had girlfriends were actually during the pandemic.

418,"As long as you aren't obese and can pass a piss test. 

That's it.  That's the litmus test. 

(Yes, there's a handful of medical DQs as well)"
419,See it like this way. You're surrounded by like-minded people.
420,That same info can be found in the articles I've read about the virus.  This shouldn't be difficult but the news got clicks and social media bullshit will do the rest.
421,"The SARS pandemic in 2003-2004 was also caused by a coronavirus.

Thus why covid is designated as SARS-COV-2."
422,There are a couple of coronavirus cold viruses. At least one of them caused a similar pandemic in the past when it was new. Covid 19 will likely end up the same.
423,"That’s like saying:

 “Barcodes have been around since 1948, but *that specific barcode number* was ~~created~~ discovered and named in 2019 and didn’t exist before then (in that sequence).”"
424,"Cool bonus: unlike COVID which flummoxed us by its transmission methods, we know that flu is transmitted by spittle droplets.  Basic masks work for flu."
425,And traces back to 50 years ago? Wow. I knew it was discovered in 2001 but it's even worse (or funnier).
426,"On top of this there is a vaccine for it in the works, same mRNA as with covid"

430,They taught us how to prevent this the last pandemic and it’s to blast your groceries/items with hand sanitizer and Lysol wipes.
431,Exactly. PC parts are made in China (like the virus).
432,"The mortality rate is 50% among birds, but that doesn't mean it'll be 50% for humans too. Just depends on how it mutates if/when it jumps to humans. We shall see. 

At least a good N95/KN95 mask will still protect you pretty well. I still have my stock from COVID."
433,Hasn't it already hit like 65 people in Alabama?
434,"The media has control of your emotions bud, zoom out a bit and learn about these things rather than giving yourself anxiety from over-sensationalized headlines"
435,See my point about the couch. And lockdown ends eventually.
436,luckily I've got broken teeth so they won't accept me
437,then close the window
438,That’s what I’m saying. If you want to convince someone that what they’re reading on social media isn’t true you should send them verifiable sources stating it rather than sending them a reddit comment.
439,"Yes, and it's relevant because the specific barcode is what decides if you get sniffles or smallpox"
440,Well that's terrible news given how many troglodytes have politicized masks and refuse to wear them.
441,So you’re telling me I ingested someone else’s mouth spittle without realising it? Just coming round from flu after having it since the week before Christmas. I had it last year too except it was flu b not flu a. I got all my vaccinations and it still knocked me down. I’d hate to see what it would be like without taking a vaccine.
442,"Yeah, its an annoying decease but it's really not a threat on par with covid like some outlets like to pretend"
443,Wait..... there's seriously ANOTHER virus that's spreading out of China?
444,and a little on the mailman just to be sure
445,"Birds also don't have much in the way of hospitals and medicine. Veterinary care exists, but it is rather inadequate for entire populations when compared with human medical care."
446,"Hook it up to the TV.

Get a new PC when lockdown ends… it’ll be time for a new one by then."
447,"Well mild inconveniences kill more Americans than plagues, you know."
448,Ever smell a fart? I've got bad news
449,"HMPV has been around forever, we have had outbreaks in the US for a long time.  It's not a new virus, it's just making the news because China can't seem to unfuck themselves."
450,"They didn’t succeed in bringing down the west last time, so they have to keep trying"
451,[removed]
452,HMPV was already discovered in 2001 and causes usually just a mild-cold.
453,"There are dozens spreading around the USA at any given time. Usually they don't cause significant enough change in symptom/mortality to be distinguished from the common cold/influenza.


Lately they've been getting a little more exotic in Asian countries (probably due to deregulation and food/industry cleanliness standards, no way to know for sure).


But there's really no reason to believe that this is **only happening** in China unless you buy into lab leak conspiracy stuff which just isn't credible enough to take seriously.


Vaccines didn't eradicate covid its still here and still mutating within our population, just much slower with longer ""evolutionary intervals"" because it can't spread her as frequently and mutate more."
454,Don't forget to vodka the mailman. *check*
455,"It's not about the option existing, it's about the convenience. Do you hook up the PC to your TV and then move it back to your office every time you wanna sit somewhere else?

Also, the last lockdown ended after a year where I lived. Do you buy a new PC every year? I assure you most people don't."
456,"Coronavirus was around for a while, too. But if it's a new, more aggressive strain then we got problems"
457,Conspiracy believers make great entertainment until you realize they're serious.
458,"You know what they say….if at first you don’t succeed, try again."
459,"This virus is basically the common cold and is already common in the US, most people here probably already had HMPV as kids."
460,[removed]
461,"I wouldn’t mind moving the tower to do that, no.  The problem with PC gaming on the couch is the mouse… and if you’re playing games that don’t really require a mouse… you don’t really need a gaming rig.

And yea mandatory lockdowns weren’t long, but being considerate and quarantining yourself lasted a few years.  I upgrade every few years."
462,It's not anything more aggressive than it was previously.  Australia came out and said it's the same thing they have seen for years.  Australia has a closer relationship with travel/tourism and trade with China. They see all the problems before the US does.
463,I remember at work when we first heard about covid. Someone was using the lysol and said hey...this shit already says coronavirus. If it's old why are we concerned?  Lmao
464,"Sars-cov-2 was not around for a while… it was first identified in 2019 and there is no evidence for it’s existence before that.  

Saying “coronavirus was around for a while too” is like discovering a completely new man / bear / pig and saying, “meh, vertebrates have been around for a while.”   

i can definitely see this being the new misinformation though…"
465,"And if that doesn't work too, third time's the charm"
466,Good to know. Thanks for the information.
467,"What’s funny is it’s reported 3 cases in India now but they say no need to worry. While the virus affects all ages it’s more serious in ages under 5 and over 65, or those with a weak immune system. Gee, where have I heard that before?"

515,"Bro your history is just comments in meme and hentai subreddits, let's calm down a bit"
516,Most black and white people in the south as well as any other race in the south mostly uses “finna” unironically that doesn’t mean they’re stupid. It’s just how southerns just talk like how sometimes they pronounce words such as instead of for example saying “that’s not right” you’ll sometimes here “that ain’t right” more often than not we speak more so less formal because once you head more and more down south it’s less cities and more rural areas where we skip pass formal language more often than not to get to the point or just saying it faster. You’ll still hear it in cities southern slag such as ‘ain’t’ [isn’t/ is not/ not] and ‘finna’ [fixing to/ about to] and ‘gonna’[about to/ going to] it’s really more of a southern thing I guarantee you if you stay in the South for considerable amount of time you will begin to speak like this despite whether you sound like a northerner or anything else. You won’t notice you using ‘finna’ until you get called out or catch yourself saying it. I live in SC you will hear it multiple times per day if not every other day then it’s everyday everyone says this and says southern slang from the white people to the black people to any Latino and Hispanic people here and even Asian American people will pick up on how we talk and speak like this. Everyone talks like that down here. Literally everyone if someone says that they are from here and don’t talk like that I will say they live in a distinct area of SC or just flat out lying to you.

HMPV was significantly worse, as far as immediate symptoms go. I took 3 weeks off of work, had 4 doctors visits and 4 different prescriptions. 

After the first 15 days and all these medications, hallucinations from lack of sleep, all of it - it turns out the miracle drug was Tylenol. Straight up acetaminophen. It turned something I felt might kill me into an unpleasant cold. It was unavoidable that my wife would catch it too. She had different doctors and prescriptions.

It's something we've already dealt with multiple times before and its genuinely not that bad (yes, it can be dangerous.

SARS and MERS attack the lower respiratory system, so they aren't as contagious. They aren't as contagious, though they still are highly, but they can be dangerous.

SARS-CoV-2 does both, so it's the worst of both worlds."

761,"Well your ""research"" is wrong. The ""common cold"" isn't caused by a single virus, but is instead a set of common symptoms caused by a large variety of different viruses like rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, CORONAVIRUSES and so on. By your definition covid-19 was also just a ""common cold"". Look how that turned out."

777,"“So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous - whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked but you’re going to test it.”

“And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting,” 

“And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?”"
778,"This meme template is being used improperly; it's supposed to be batman correcting robin, instead of giving equally wrong information.

HMPV is not a new virus, it doesn't spread rapidly like COVID-19, it has milder symptoms and a lower mortality rate; primarily causing deaths in vulnerable groups. The WHO has not declared it a pandemic and experts say it is unlikely to become one. Rather, its spread in China fits seasonal patterns. Most people are infected with HMPV in early life, and while reinfections are possible, their severity usually is reduced because of partial immunity acquired from past exposures.

HMPV causes flu-like symptoms and can cause more severe lung infections; much unlike the common cold."
779,"Technically, the common cold is *a* coronavirus..."
780,"Also they put Dihydrogen Monoxide into EVERYTHING! The food, every kind of drink, it's even in the air we breathe!"
781,"As far as I have understood it is a little more complicated than that

It's not ""the common cold"", but a already known strain of the influenza virus that is rather common in a lot of ""western"" countries, but the reason for the problem is that it is an UNCOMMON strain in China which makes it a problem, and makes it a local epidemic

But you are right in it is not the next coronavirus, since it is already a current and rather old coronavirus. Just not a new pandemic Covid strain"

To test for this it's a next day out to our main lab wich runs the Biofire RP2.0 panel. It's not cheap tho. Idk what we bill but the kit is 3500 for a box of 30."

The sickness sucked. It started off as one of the worst sore throats I've ever had, and then I got headaches so intense that they became migraines, and one morning I was up for 4 hours clutching a bucket and periodically vomitting until I was able to call my dad and he came and gave me some STRONG painkillers to knock me out. Now for the past week I've had a lingering cough that looks like it's going to stick around for a while. It wasn't covid, I tested twice on two different days.

As soon as the sore throat became an issue, I stayed home from work, and I didn't go back until I was certain I wasn't contagious anymore. I feel awful if someone catches a sickness off me."
854,"Man, I wish people stayed home if they were sick.  
I work at retail (a toy store, so nothing essential that makes sick people NEED to go despite being sick), and you don’t want to know how much people cough and sneeze with an open mouth right in my face. I get some people have Atsma and stuff like that, but I can guarantee you most of them do not.  
I’m not even asking them to wear a mask, but at least do it in your elbow and away from me"
855,"Yep, cold is a symptom, not the disease itself."
856,">The ""common cold"" isn't caused by a single virus, but is instead a set of common symptoms caused by a large variety of different viruses like rhinoviruses

Yes. If any one of those virus variant from the set of viruses causing common cold like symptoms, progresses further and causes severe symptoms, then it would be classified as a seperate infection and given a seperate name.   

By this definition (and most probably) COVID-19 is a type of common cold virus. If it did not cause severe symptoms or high rate of infection then it would be literally classified as common cold. Heck, the ultimate fate of COVID-19 (by most estimated consensus) is that it will become a part of common cold. As much was said when I was infected with COVID-19 recently - no major symptoms other than light stuffy nose and body pain and my wife literally has no symptoms.    


By the same way, if the HMPV is not causing severe symptoms or high rate of infection then by default it will be part of common cold."
857,Lots of people said it was just the flu…and then we had refrigerated truck morgues outside of hospitals.
858,">corona was also just a ""common cold""

*covid, right? Sars is a type of a corona virus which causes covid, the disease. Also the names here are incomplete."
859,I mean COVID-19 was just a common cold lol
860,"""Common cold"" is a symptom caused by a large group of viruses, and this is one virus that causes common cold, would it be incorrect to call it a common cold virus?"
861,There were tons of people saying covid was just like the common cold in 2019...
862,Yes it was a common cold! Perhaps a bit worse but the reaction to it was exaggerated. Plus I think herd immunity was better than untested mRNA vaccines.
863,"Didn’t go to well from what I recall. However there’s some real sad injustice going on with the millions of people every year before Covid happened that died from getting a cold/flu that progressed to be worse.. and they never got their death counter on the news. Same numbers, just not news worthy i guess 🤷‍♂️"

You can’t spread viruses, they are results of bacteria that we are excreting from our body when we go through a detox.

Well, we didn't even have to wait very long to learn that the first one already sucks,  with heart, lung and brain damage and long COVID.  Common cold my ass.  So I'm gonna have to go with the vaccine, which also contributes to the possibility of herd immunity.

Of course, we didn't get enough of the herd vaccinated in time, so the virus out-evolved the possibility of herd immunity.  Now people get the actual disease multiple times, immunity be damned. Fortunately the vaccinated have better outcomes, so fewer of us need to deal with long term effects."
916,"A lot of people die yearly from a large variety of pathogens yes. That is indeed not newsworthy. Corona was different because it was ONE single pathogen that killed millions globally in a very short time period, a pandemic. Pandemics are newsworthy because they affect everyone on earth.

It also happens to help save lives against more dangerous virus like the polio. Perhaps certain people does have adverse reactions to certain vaccines (maybe allergic reactions?) but on the whole vaccines does help the general population avoid devastating illness from spreading.

947,"I was an essential employee due to working in a personal care type place. There were so many people that quit, some even a year or so out from retirement, because of all the weekly testing, the inconsistent enforcement of the rules, etc.  

We were also given specific covid sick time for about two years, then it was suddenly dropped while testing continued and mandatory 10-14 days of time off for testing positive. They would not accept an outside test even if it was through a doctors office to prove you were negative, however if you missed testing you had to show proof that you had a rapid test scheduled at a pharmacy or doctors office before you could come in to work. Weekly testing only ended a few months ago.  

We also lost a fair amount of employees after vaccines became mandatory unless you had a religious or health exemption."
948,"More like the majority of people, still the same point though."
949,"Idk about HIV, but yeah: sore throat, stuffy runny nose, and coughing are just super standard illness symptoms. Like half of the diseases you might catch have them."
950,"True. But no one here is ""downplaying"" the actual severity of infection as literally there is either not much data available or no credible data for severe infection. By my estimate from News frenzy, it is definitely over estimating than vigilant.   


Ultimately, be cautious and practice common sense hygiene, don't be alarming or anxious. Comparing it to COVID-19 is definitely not a good course of action as people will be anxious rather than cautious. No need to spend our social and scientific capital on unfounded alarmism than actual science."

959,Oh no! Anyways...
960,Of course they do. But imagine how bad it would be without the tin foil hat heroes.
961,"Nah, they left the plasmid DNA from the mRNA encryption process in because it was too expensive to remove (though they removed it during the testing phase). Basically they had huge vats of industrial plasmid cranking out mRNA for the vaccine, but it was too expensive to ""strain"" the DNA out with the massive numbers of injections they needed.

The DNA is coated with the same lipid nanoparticles, so they get entry into cells just like the mRNA does. This is why you're seeing turbo cancer and heart attacks - changed genome in stem cells causes the cancer, changed cardiac cell genome and the subsequent autoimmune attacks cause myocarditis."
962,"For me it wasn’t any worse than a cold, for others it was really bad."
963,Bro it killed over 7 million people.
964,"That's because they didn't expect people to ignore all of the safety precautions they outlined. It wouldn't have been a big deal, but people happened."
965,I'm talking about the influenza outbreak in 1929. Common sense was actually common so people stayed home when they were told so it resolved a lot quicker.
966,"You're not wrong, but the reason it was worse for some people and barely a cold for others is that a lot of people most affected had comorbidity. It hit me like a dump truck that stopped and ran over me several times. I was also 100lb overweight at the time, smoking a pack and a half of cigarettes a day, living off ramen and leftover pizza, not exercising, and not drinking enough water. It was indeed like the flu, but I also hadn't had flu-like symptoms or even a fever for almost 30 years at that point, so it sucked.

If they would have followed the traditional route of testing the vaccine much like the flu or polio, I would agree, but they didn't."
972,"Pretty sure it’s known bullshit now.  Go look up how the efficacy of the vaccine slowly over time dwindled in its ability to keep you from getting sick.  You didn’t take it for your health, you were peer pressured into it and offered free fucking donuts and French fries while you drove up and had some stranger in a parking lot jab you with a syringe.  You all deserve every horrible thing that it could possibly cause in the long term."

Additionally, my father has a rare syndrome and fortunately never contracted covid, but data showed that had he contracted it, there was a chance it could cause a relapse in his condition, which would be fatal.  You see, shutting down the world wasn't to protect you and me, it was to protect people who were at much higher risk."

I’m pretty sure the vaccine has to undergo clinical test (or whatever the term is, basically multiple people from different parts of the of the population test the vaccine first) before being allowed to be distributed to the rest of the population. 
Where did you get this idea from?"
1000,"1. [Literally the first thing that popped up on google](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/how-they-work.html)
2. There will ALWAYS be a few people who get very bad effects from vaccines and medicine in general. It has always been this way and will always be this way, because no one is an exact copy of anybody else."
1001,"And even more people would have died if they spent more time testing the vaccine. There's only a tiny percentage of people who had adverse effects after getting vaccinated, just like with any other vaccine."
1002,"I’m sorry I’m not from the united states of fucking “freedom”. We didn’t take it for food or whatever “benefits” there are, although I do think such incentives may be required to get ppl to even seriously consider taking the vaccine.

Btw virus mutates, much quicker than human. This old vaccines could be less effective against new strains of the virus. This why some governments suggest the population to take the booster vaccine, to protect and reinforce protection against the virus and its new variant.

1005,"The point of the mask is to reduce the spread of the virus, take Covid for example, Covid spread via droplets from body fluids. The mask catches the fluids and reduces the spread to the surrounding, reducing infection. 
Who told you mask stop you from breathing in the virus?"
1006,"My guy, it's literally been 5 years and you STILL don't understand the purpose of a mask? Viruses need a vehicle to travel, the mask prevents the vast majority of viral particles from escaping into the air by capturing the vehicle aka saliva and evaporating water. Masks aren't to protect yourself, they're primarily used to protect others. A surgeon doesn't wear a mask during surgery to protect themselves from your disease, it's so their viruses and bacteria has a lower chance of getting into your open wound.


My friend, how dumb are you?"
1007,"Yes, obviously the virus is small enough to pass through the fibers of the mask. But many illnesses are only transmitted through vapor or body fluids. The droplets do not pass through the mask. That is the point. Also, even for illnesses that can be transferred simply through breathing the air, it is less likely to transfer if the pathogen is not being projectile spewed out farther through sneezing and coughing when there is no mask. Masks reduce transmission rates of Covid. 

It's honestly hard for me to believe that you're being serious when you're still using that argument in 2025. You read online for 10 minutes and suddenly think you know more than people that have been studying a subject as a full-time job for 40 years."

We still don't, again I have no issues with vaccines, they absolutely work, just have to do them the right way."

1034,"Again, they don't work like people think they do. If you sneeze in a mask everything blows out the back, away from the patient. It doesn't stop things from escaping, it will redirect. But the mask will still let things escape from the front as well. Talk to any medical professional and they will tell you. I have family that works in surgery and they are trained that masks do what I just said."
1035,"So because I stated a fact you just now insult me? I must have hit a nerve 😂. Good thing I didn't study biology in college. Good thing I don't understand how microorganisms function and how they enter the human body. Good thing I don't know that if you can exchange air while breathing that you're also breathing in viruses and bacteria. Good thing you can still breath while wearing a mask and viruses can absolutely still get in. Yes you're right, I don't understand 😂"
1036,This type aren't usually the ones that think about the impact they may have on others. All about me baby!
1037,"Water droplets can still escape the mask, why do people think a mask is a magic thing that fixes everything. It may reduce extremely large particles like flem, but water droplets can absolutely still get through."
1038,"Did you know if you sneeze in a mask it all gets blown out the back? You didn't. Did you know when you're trained in the medical field, when wearing a mask you never turn your head to sneeze or cough, you sneeze or cough straight ahead at the patient because the back of the mask will let everything escape. It is ok that you didn't go to medical school, or that no one in your family did. But it's also ok to ask a medical professional how they work. They aren't 100% and they absolutely still let particles out."
1039,"As I have stated in other comments, masks don't work the way you think they do. If you sneeze in a mask, the particles will blow out the back, still not stopping much. I agree it may reduce if properly worn, but it will absolutely still let particles through. For the people who have been studying a subject for 40 years, they will tell you the same thing about masks. I have family that work in surgery and they are trained how masks work. If you sneeze or cough you continue to face the patient because it will blow out the back of the mask, thus less chance of the patient being exposed to particles. But the particles are still escaping and are now in the air."

And of course the font cover their mouth with their hands, the mask protects most of the particles and they need their hands sanitary. I don't know what your problem with masks is, it's literally not a hard concept. Since when did being dumb as fuck become essentially a fashion statement on America?"
1064,"You said that masks don't work, then proceeded to explain how they do work. SMH. You are on another level."
1065,Oh yeah that was definitely tongue-in-cheek of me ;)
1066,"That's fair. 

The American healthcare industry has done a lot of shady things over the years. I think right now is probably the most transparent the healthcare industry has ever been due to the internet and the ability to share information so quickly. There is a lot of distrust in these systems and the establishment that allowed for it/profited from it. 

That's not to say that the healthcare industry manipulated and lied to citizens to make money during Covid, I just don't think the healthcare industry gets the right to say ""well when have we ever lied to the public"" as a defense. 

No matter if they lied during Covid, i just want people to know the truth. But I don't have an answer. You don't have an answer. No one in the public really knows for sure. I do think there should be investigations because of the history of these types of corporations and government agencies. And whether or not they lied, they *have* profited off of Covid."

1070,You're missing my point and that's ok. I have agreed that properly trialed vaccines work. I'm done repeating myself.
1071,"I agree, I have agreed this whole time, people skip that line when reading my comments. I'm saying people think masks work in a magical way, they don't. They have to be worn properly and they aren't. If you're standing in line at a store with a mask, and someone in front of you sneezes you are being exposed. People don't seem to understand that. That's all I'm trying to say. This whole conversation has been me saying vaccines work, just need to be properly tested and trialed and masks work if properly understood and worn.

1493,"For starters,  HMPV ( AKA Human metapneumovirus) was originally found in 2001. The disease is contagious through interactions such as spreading through contact with surfaces, coughing, sneezing, and close contact in general.
To avoid it, clean surfaces often used by others, and for the love of god WASH YOUR HANDS!!! There is no vaccine or antiviral therapy to treat the disease itself. The disease usually lasts 7-10 days, so similarly to covid.

For the details about the virus's mortality rate or the effects, please research it through credible sites as well.

If you haven't sat down and pondered just how potent they are in any offensive capability, and how they've essentially put Infantry, Air Force and Navy out of buisness except for mutually assured nuclear destruction, then you're on the spectrum. 

A swarm of 20 drones can drop thermite on a fleet of aircraft and immobilize them for years or permanently.

A swarm of drones can drop bio weapons on a population, and you can *try* to trace them. 

This isn't a conspiracy anymore. You need to smell the coffee."
1741,"Sorta. They both descend from a bigger family of viruses and are not mutations of one another but just notable jumps from animal to human which allowed for further human infection.

Sars cov 1 is normally just called sars and likely came from civets.

Sars cov 2 is largely called covid-19 and probly has bats to blame.

Long story short, we ain't gonna do much to sort any new stuff turning up so just gotta hope folks trust the experts if it does become a thing.

1749,"Oh wow, why has no one thought of that?"
1750,Yeah no. The moment Russia attempted to seize a sovereign nation was the moment they deserved to get their asses kicked. Us funding Ukraine has severely set back one of our biggest geopolitical rivals AND maintains Ukraine's sovereignty. The only peace deal that Ukraine should accept is 1) complete removal of Russian forces from Ukraine and 2) membership in NATO. Anything short of that is basically pandering to Russian interests in trying to absorb more and more of their neighbors.
1751,"They didn't send money over there, they send ammo and weapons from US Army stockpiles that otherwise would just have collected dust anyway. These have a pricetag on them of 60 Billion but this money is basically from the defense budgets of the past 10 years when the stuff was bought.

And since the US Army is going to continue to buy from the Military Industrial Complex regardless whether they need it or not they are probably glad that they could make some room for newly bought weapons and ammo."
1752,"Nobody:

This guy: Ukraine 🤬

Everyone else: Ahhh yeah, common knowledge.


But seriously the stimulus program is the cause of most of our current inflation (turns out you can't just print money who would've thought) believe it or not we've been ""nation"" building since after ww2. Korea showed us how much fun it is to stick our head in other people's business. From there we've just been doing a ton of it. But yes I know there are many factors due to our current economic state. Honestly you could of picked like 5 or 10 other things and everyone would of been like fair.  Enjoy life the world is fake anyway and the points really don't matter"

Además, China siempre ha sido foco de infección de muchas enfermedades respiratorias por la alta densidad de su población y una mala educación sanitaria en general. Hasta que la OMS no declare una pandemia, no se pongan a comprar papel de baño a lo pendejo. Además, no es un virus nuevo, y las medidas de prevención son casi las mismas que para el COVID: cubrebocas y lavarse las manos. Si sienten ansiedad por la noticia, ponganse su cubrebocas y lleven su gel. Pero dejen de propagar histeria, informense bien antes de publicar.

El problema es que desde la pandemia hay mil Fake news y mil ""pandemias"" a cada rato entonces ya no se sabe si es cierto o no, no confiaría mucho en esa noticia pero si ocurre una nueva pandemia va a empezar en países super poblados como china o india"

2144,"Ahí es donde te equivocas, la OMS reportó los contagios en china desde 2019. Y hay registro.

No hay que empezar de conspiranoicos porque nos pasó con el Ebola, donde la gente tenía pánico por el Ebola y hasta medios de comunicación pendejos ponían vídeos de películas de zombies como Ebola.

Hay que esperar a que la OMS diga algo o incluso estar al pendiente de medios de comunicación chinos, que por muy totalitarios que sean, no son Corea del Norte, estos si reportan todo."

2154,Sí es lo que he notado
2155,"Volvemos a lo mismo.1.- La información no la puedes tomar sólo de fuentes que a ti te agradan, que dicen lo que quieres escuchar, a eso se le llama SESGO DE CONFIRMACIÓN. Para dar una información IMPARCIAL y OBJETIVA, se tiene que analizar todo tipo de fuentes. 
Esos que lo único que saben decir ""Ai eZKe LoZ KomMuniZtaZ XinoZ HoKultHaN IMPHormaSZYon"", son personas que no tienen un criterio propio, no tienen capacidad de análisis. (Todos los gobiernos ante crisis sanitarias ocultan datos reales para EVITAR LA HISTERIA COLECTIVA, eso no es exclusivo de un gobierno sólo porque sean unos sucios y malos comunistas, pensar de esa manera es caer en sesgos cognitivos). 
2.-Ahora, si te pones a investigar los comunicados OFICIALES no solo del gobierno chino, sino de la OMS, de la UNICEF, o de los gobiernos de cada país, ninguno ha dado un comunicado sobre el tema. 
3.- este METAPNEUMOVIRUS ni siquiera es un virus nuevo, como lo fue en su momento el SarsCov2 (covid19), sino que ya tienen registros  desde el 2001.

2157,"No, solo es covid-19 lo era. Lo que complica un poco las cosas es que mutan regularmente, cambiando las glicoproteínas de su envoltura, lo que hace que las vacunas se vuelvan inefectivas. Por esto no tenemos vacuna contra el VIH aún."
2158,"No puedo evitar pensar en [este pelmazo](https://youtu.be/n3ucv8l0d1U?si=uTgI69ZSAA3mq_5z) cada que alguien dice que no puede haber otra cuarentena. Es cierto que fue muy difícil para las poblaciones más vulnerables, pero también es cierto que fue una época de cambios para muchos profesionista y empleados, que les permitió desarrollar nuevas habilidades y adaptarse a medios digitales que nunca imaginaron."

Personalmente aprendí muchísimo más en remoto, en las clases presenciales perdía mucho tiempo en las horas muertas entre clases y en el traslado.
Aplica igual para el trabajo, en muchos casos las oficinas están demás, y el trabajo presencial solo es justificable en las fábricas y laboratorios."

2166,"Recuerdo que cuando estaba empezando el COVID por ahí por enero o febrero del 2020 había varios videos en Reddit de caos en hospitales chinos.

2308,Bhai khushiya mat bna they will consider pre board results where prob everyone flops.
2309,None. This virus is overhyped asf. I have Ocd so i research about viruses a lot so i can fear them less and this virus is nothing to be scared of.

chemistry is even easier, questions mostly theoretical hi hai, follow same method for physical chem and some parts of organic and you are good to go"
2352,"90% gonna be harder, but with great revision and prep you can get it.

80% is much easier though.

Boards ask Basic questions from ncert. With enough Basic concept practice in physics you could do most of the questions (somehow people were saying last year that physics was tough, even though it was still pretty easy)

I did aakash tho and practiced their modules, so maybe I'm a bit biased towards board being easy, idk."

Debido a que son un chingo y viven todos juntos, no es raro que algún virus tenga un brote importante en China pero que no pase a mayores y no se vuelva pandemia."

2438,"De acuerdo con múltiples artículos, no es un virus nuevo, es altamente contagioso pero no es letal en la mayoría de las personas (ojo, grupos vulnerables siempre han estado bajo riesgo). No quiero sonar como esos pendejos del HermanCainAward que decían “0.10 fatality rate”, no voy a eso. Lo que quiero decir es que aunque es una enfermedad muy contagiosa y, por lo que leí, si te pega duro, no es tan peligrosa como otras enfermedades de esta temporada, sobre todo como el COVID19 o la influenza. Pero si algo nos pudo enseñar la pandemia del 2020 es que el cubrebocas y el lavado de manos es excelente método de prevención contra muchas enfermedades respiratorias"

Esperemos."

Siguen saliendo todos enfermos y sin cubrebocas, siguen sin respetar el espacio personal, se burlan si no quieres saludarles de beso o de mano. 

No prendimos nada porque yo estoy casi seguro que van a ser más los conspiranoicos o los que lo minimizan"
2630,los humanos somos expertos en cagarla una y otra vez en lo mismo
2631,"Hasta crees que los mexicanos van a aprender

En mi familia se murieron varios de COVID y aún así dicen que todo fue un invento del gobierno para reducir la población, y que la vacuna te instala el windows XP en el cerebro o alguna mmda así"

En un Grupo en FB un ""participante anónimo"" lleva semanas colando este tipo de noticias."

2642,"Ahí mismo dice, que China no ha confirmado nada"
2643,"De hecho si es preocupante porque en estas fechas (creo que a finales de este mes) es la celebración del año nuevo lunar que es la celebración más importante para los chinos, y como sucede en México con Navidad y Año Nuevo que mucha gente se regresa a sus pueblos a visitar a sus familias, en este caso sucede lo mismo; la mayoría de chinos en el extranjero regresarán a su país para visitar a sus familias y cuando regresen traerán el virus consigo.

Aunque también el virus puede venir de alguien que se haya ido a vacacionar allá como sucedió con el COVID, que en muchos países se dio por gente que fue de vacaciones a China y regreso infectada."
2644,¿De un jalón de verga?
2645,Sólo tú disfrutarías eso.

2649,Es fake. Solo que las cuentas conspiranoicas la están haciendo viral
2650,Te estás tardando…
2651,De ahí mero viene. Hay una epidemia ahí ahorita.
2652,genera interacciones
2653,El comentario correcto es cuantos van a caer? ☠️
2654,"La vacuna no fue para que no te enfermaras, era para disminuir tus probabilidades de morir al contagiarte. 7 de cada 100 se morían, a mayor edad, mayor probabilidad. La vacuna tiene efectos adversos, claro, como muchas vacunas el día de hoy, sentirse un poco mal es mucho mejor que exponerse a morir de COVID.

Nadie se cree la jalada ""solo para hacer Home Office"", es porque los sitios amarillistas les encanta el mame, si con alguien deberías enojarte sería con esos sitios, no con la vacuna, y de preferencia no un berrinche, sino algo que desmienta lo que dicen con evidencias... O no, esto es reddit después de todo."
2655,La gente es muy pendeja vulve a caer en errores y no dudo que si llega eso a México otra vez pasaremos mal otra pandemia
2656,"Porque existen diferentes tipos de virus con diferentes maneras de contagio obviamente los que se propagan más fácilmente son aquellos que se transmiten realizando la actividad más cotidiana que existe que es respirar. 

No creo que todo mundo ande por la vida metiéndose los dedos en la boca después de haber estado tocando materia fecal, ni dejando que les piquen insectos hematófagos, ingiriendo alimentos o bebidas contaminados, o teniendo sexo sin proteccion a diario.

Los virus que afectan a las vías respiratorias se propagan en el aire, asi que cuando estamos cerca de una persona infectada que obviamente no sabemos a simple vista si lo está o no estamos totalmente expuestos al contagio ya que esta persona está dispersando el virus un par de metros a su alrededor mientras exhala, habla, tose y/o estornuda.

Espero haber resuelto tu duda de manera satisfactoria, saludos"

2747,"True ..bro ....when everyone makes fun of lockdown..or say that please bring that time ....

It's very hard for me because I lost my uncle and aunty both ..their daughter was just 3 that time ..it's very sad...
I have seen the situations of hospitals  that time .."
2748,One more pandemic and I will kms.
2749,This is so real bro I can’t believe people are immature enough to pray for another pandemic like bro.
2750,It is not going to create a pandemic now if it couldn't in last 25 years.
2751,"man this covid really messed up my immune system along with those vaccines. idt people should be expecting another pandemic. we're lucky that we were able to overcome covid, but another one would just be annoying and disastrous."
2752,true but afaik it's pretty non-lethal like covi-oh wait
2753,"As much as I want my boards to get cancelled, I don't want anyone to go through those times anymore. I don't want families to suffer or get torn apart again just because we had a silly wish. 
(Also preboard marks was pretty bad so I don't want that to be counted)"
2754,+1&#10;I remember vividly how corona fuckedup my school life. Dont want this new virus to fuck up my college as well. From a 12thie
2755,Fr
2756,"Some prudence at last from someone. COVID was not a joke. Many of us lost our Indian brothers and sisters, relatives, neighbours, and family members. Pray for better days ahead. Strive to succeed. May everyone get good grades in their exams.

My father served during Covid, and I will never forget how difficult things were for us. Our entire family contracted the infection. Pray for the safety of everyone around the world."
2757,"juniors,trust me it's the worst thing imaginable. Tumhari social life chud jayegi, kuch padhai nahi hone wali, you'll get so comfortable with online classes and exams that you simply wouldn't want to study. Also if you happen to be in 10th grade you'll miss out on most of the very best years of your school life if we happen to have another lockdown for 2 years. As OP said pandemic and lockdown ke liye pray karne ki jagah padh lo"
2758,"No, I dont want any pandemic anymore please 😭😭😭
I've had enough now"
2759,One of my friends said ki marte time logon ko pta bhi bhi chlta isliye cheer kr rha hu like bro literally thinks people don't suffer when dying
2760,Finally someone speaking about this Stupid joke
2761,"I lost my fucking 11th and 12th school life to covid 

it isnt fun guys , the impact of that lockdown is still in younger students!"
2762,no i dont want  a lockdown..agar boards cancel ho gaye tho pre boards ka average marks lenge..mera pre board ka average low hai (all thanks to phy)
2763,"aye no lockdown and all  
covid  took away 2 fuckin years of my life  
agar lockdown agaya then they'll take pre board marks..then im cooked"
2764,"i do not want a lockdown, again. PLEASE"
2765,The worst part about cancer is ...
2766,"ye jo chutiye bacche aaj boards ke liye HMPV chah rahe hain...
ye kya jaanein what our lives became, the one covered by our gaming and excessive time wasting. 
it looks fine for a week. 
but trust me buddy, you don't want that life."
2767,"Seriously yaar, both my parents sare doctors and they were previously doctors in army when Covid started so we atleast got rations and they still had their full salary during all those years of Covid pandemic. Now their service is over and they're working in private, so my mum said it's better that this virus doesn't cause another lockdown, because the doctors would have to work A LOT, would be the most vulnerable to the virus and wouldn't even get their pay. I felt so sad listening to her"
2768,Hater hai bhai
2769,[deleted]
2770,"same, dont want my preboard marks to be counted"
2771,oho indian economy
2772,Stole my words! I agree with you. I believe that a lockdown has very short-term benefits like it only ever helps to decrease the spread of the virus. But society is more than that. We took 2 awkward years (2021 and till mid 2022) to reverse the damages by the pandemic and WE WILL NOT PRAY FOR ANOTHER DOWNFALL PERIODT💯

2785,"No one can predict anything for now. God knows how many mutations it may have undergone in the past year, forget 25 years. All we can do is hope that the situation isn't too severe.

And thank god that China didn't hide information about this disease before it got too late (like COVID-19)"
2786,you seem to imply that the vaccine's fucked your immune system up? please dont tell me an anti vaxxer exists
2787,and also march se yeh ek exam ke liye padh rahi hoon...agar cancel ho gaya tho ek saal barbaad
2788,"Is it still worth all the death and suffering it brought? The social lives of so many people ruined, families torn apart, economies crashed...

India's economy can't take another hit, especially from a pandemic. Sure, it was relaxing to stay at home but the moment the disease decides to snatch the lives of your loved ones, you get a whole new perspective on these diseases."

That's what you are saying, dude. Get some sense in that brain of yours."
2796,kinda suicidal but truly w tho
2797,"There no such thing as God, anyways the mutations this virus can undergo is not going to be extreme, if it was it would've been visible years ago not out the blue in 2025 and not to mention the media even mark normal cough and cold as HVMP just the same way did for COVID, same for the hospitals to cash in more money (and it happens, doctors are no saints) 

Secondly, we don't really if the info about China is real or fake, because they're very strict about their country's state news travelling to the world."
2798,"I didn't really say that vaccines messed my immune system up (probably shouldn't have said those in the same sentence) . I caught covid thrice, and it wasn't a pleasant experience. The whole situation with being locked down at home for 2 years along with having to get vaccines just can't be termed as a good experience. stressful af. i honestly think that vaccines were a boon to society, without them the situation could've been much worse."

2817,It's not new. It's a virus that's been around since ~2000. The only reason it's spreading anywhere now is because it's winter. There's no reason to compare it to Covid. Flu A is spreading in parts of the US and is pretty bad right now but no one is saying that's like Covid
2818,No way that this will be again
2819,we got a mcFucking plague sequel before silksong smh
2820,Hump virus
2821,😷
2822,"this virus has existed for decades. people get it all the time. it’s seasonal and causes cold-like respiratory symptoms. sometimes it can be a bit more severe and cause bronchitis. again, it’s very common and has been around for a while. herd immunity to this virus is widespread so a pandemic is not likely. this is just a winter surge. 

this is not something to fear monger"
2823,let see what happens
2824,"Ah shit, here we go again"
2825,No
2826,Well Jan2025 starts with WTF same as 2020
2827,We got Covid 2.0 before gta6
2828,"Once again, can we stop fear mongering about this shit? It's a known illness that is spreading during the flu season in China. This happens every year and is not comparable to COVID. Please stop posting this bullshit"
2829,Second COVID before gta 6.
2830,"Didn’t know a comment section could be this damn stupid, hMPV originated from the Netherlands in 2001.
If you do nuke China, it would harm Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and other neighbouring countries."
2831,Oh noo. I just survived the previous pandemic without getting vaccinated and without catching Covid
2832,"World Wars moment.

2842,2 plagues before GTA 6
2843,ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOU-
2844,😂
2845,China and the pandemic are more consistent with sequels than Valve and Gabe
2846,"I’m a Pediatric Pulmonary RN. This is NOT a new virus. This is already very well established in the US. From Wikipedia:

“As of 2016, it was the second most common cause (after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) of acute respiratory tract illness in otherwise-healthy children under the age of 5 in a large US outpatient clinic.[3]”

We’ve already reached some sort of equilibrium with this virus in our population. China is just having a local epidemic. Which is different from a pandemic. I know everyone’s still a bit traumatized by Covid 19, but this is not equivalent. Please, stop spreading unfounded fear."
2847,"Tabloids spreading fear for momey, governments spreading fear for power, people spreading fear for clicks."
2848,I've heard a couple of things about this and all I can say is you should probably do research on it.
2849,Don't forget about H5N10
2850,PLANdemic

2852,I don't think that my psyche will survive another lockdown.

2854,Did this one also come from a bat?
2855,*experiences 2020 flashback*
2856,I had a bit of a feeling this was gonna happen again
2857,"There have been half a dozen “the next Covid” since Covid. It’s because news media learned they got tons of clicks by scaring the public with Covid news. To be clear, Covid was extremely deadly when we were in lockdown. As a nurse who was on the front lines, I would never play that down. Just keep in mind that the media just wants clicks like it got during COVID, and they’ll hype up whatever virus they can find to spin that story."
2858,But is It woke? :-P
2859,God dammit China AGAIN

2870,"This is dumb, and wrong"

2873,Oh yes it will. Another pandemic and a police state are on the rise.
2874,Covid 25 before GTA6
2875,Just hide out in Greenland for another 5 years
2876,Saying “not something to fear monger” is what I imagine would be the last line in the “corporate dude makes suggestion and gets thrown out of high-rise window” meme. Probably in a media place where they’re brainstorming how to deliver the news on this new virus from China
2877,Thx to the TikTok videos
2878,"Luckily I stopped after the 2nd shot, my Covid flu lasted only 3-4 days"
2879,Your where more fortunate than me
2880,Ofc it's from china ... that shithole needs to be nuked clean
2881,At this point this news is just being used by some as an excuse for open sinophobia. HMPV has been around for years now including in the US but the instant its in China all the racism comes out.

2899,1.4B people need to be vaporized in a nuclear inferno because a seasonal flu exists?
2900,But there has never been a “first nuked”
2901,"Always funny to me.

Like China isn't one of if not the most racist country on earth. They don't even like their own people if they're not Han Chinese. And their government is actively hostile to the west. And they're 0 for 7 on containing pandemic level viruses because their country is an open air sewer next to a manufacturing plant with so many homo sapiens they scurry about like rats."
2902,"Imagine speaking out against a comment that casually encourages genocide and murder of an entire nation as if 1 billion people deserve the death penalty, then getting downvoted into oblivion.

Instead of Chinese people being viewed as the ""first victims"" or ""biggest victims"", they are instead being joked about as foreign nuisances to be eradicated, not even to be considered human.

If my country requires aid from a new disease, I worry the sentiment will be the same."

2907,"\>Like China isn't one of if not the most racist country on earth.

Racist and fucking proud. This is not Europe mate, Chinese people aren't like the white who are getting cucked by the migrants, raping the native white people, and native white people can't do shit about it, because you know... ""YOU ARE FAR RIGHT, YOU ARE A FACISTTTTT CUH"". Lmao, it is always funny asf to me how white people aren't talking about this hard enough, when their native race is decreasing and decreasing, your countries are getting invaded by 3rd worlders without using guns and knives.

EDIT: Appears to me that I have hit some nerves. Maybe it is the white cucks or the migrants, lmao."
2908,You are literally calling for genocide
2909,Have you considered putting an end to your worthless life? Because you really should.
2910,Shut up pussy

I'm sure we can agree that all genocide is bad."

2914,You are of weak mind and body. Farmer
2915,"Thanks for abusing the report for Reddit resources, enjoy your ban 😑"
2916,You mean like how the Nazis thought Jewish people were detrimental to the rest of the world?
2917,And the US isn’t? What countries has China invaded? Now compare that with the list of countries invaded by the US
2918,So is the US
2919,Yeah you're just a racist piece of shit
2920,Pathetic and weak comeback. No wonder why the UK is crumbling with smooth brain like you being allowed to use the internet
2921,"It's ""r/memes"" who gives a fuck LMFAO"
2922,Jewish people didn't spread plagues or heavily contribute to climate change
2923,"Chinese isn't a race, it's an ethnicity"
2924,The UK is crumbling yet Chinese people have suicide nets outside their workplaces and get paid terrible money to make the clothes I wear lol. Be quiet flat head
2925,The Nazis definitely seemed to think Jewish people were spreading plagues.
2926,"Terrible argument. 

BTW, when it comes to c02. When you add up all the C02. America is the worst offender.

So tell me. Can we remove America? If you are so happy to nuke a country. I know a good country. 

It has blue and red stripes with 50 stars.

It has a orange President and it just happens to threaten my country with a 25% tarrifs and it government threatens the ICJ. 

The United States was the biggest emitter in history as of 2023, having released some 430 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (GtCO₂) into the atmosphere since the birth of the industrial revolution"
2927,"**That's the worst argument...**

USA struggled heavily with containing COVID, they were one of the worst at handling it compared to other first world nations.

Though their rates of emission per year is currently less than China, in total, USA has created the most CO2. Even if you believe China is severly under reporting, that would still make USA the 2nd highest emitter of CO2.

Besides the fact that genocide is wrong (hot take alert), your logic clearly doesn't track at all."
2928,The most notorious one being communism. /s
2929,What's that got to do with Jewish people?
2930,What the fuck do you think?
2931,"It’s not about how it relates to jewish people, it’s about how your claims correlate with the things Nazis said about Jewish people."
2932,Lmao. Such a dumbass that you forgot you're the one that brought up climate change.
2933,This could very well be China fear mongering international media (especially our own) only to play victim later by showing a high but false initial numbers of the virus.

In China, it’s normal to have the flu in winter, but that doesn’t mean we should neglect precautions.

Apart from that Zinc Magnesium and Potassium is needed  to activate the immune system T cells at thymus gland, a part below the throat and in between the chest. It would be obvious that if you're inside the house all the time the vitamin D intake becomes a must thing.

3196,One of my known came from Bangalore and had symptoms of common cold/flu. So I prescribed her otc and symptomatic treatment as we all do in a case of viral flu but even after 5 days her symptoms worsened like chest pain and breathing difficulty with copious mucus discharge she got okay but I had to give her lot of cough expectorants and bronchodilators. I’m experiencing same symptoms now. Par it with Covid 19 first wave. Not stronger than second one but it surely affected my chest same way it’s doing to me now. All I can say is too be warned it could cause a major outbreak.
3197,">  covid was not common cold, it took a lot of lives, hmpv can too

In hindsight, covid numbers are slightly higher than seasonal flu, with a lot of downward revisions from lots of countries. Amid the swirl of conspiracy theories, even with taking the top bracket of the numbers, it's not exceed 7M spread over 2-3yrs wwide.

So it MAY be an issue but not drastically so, if it's a variant of flu again."
3198,"Just by the fact that it existed and had done rounds of a few countries, I wouldn't alarm myself on its potential to affect people adversely (given they are already healthy).

3215,"If you’re poor enough to not be insured your daughter will almost certainly qualify for emergency Medicaid which will cover the entire visit including urgent care and hospitalization. 

I would like to clarify as well that an O2 sat of 82% and Lower Lobe pneumonia is not a garden variety flu, it’s a respiratory infection that, without treatment, has a very real possibility of killing your child in the next day or two.  Whatever the cost, you’ve gotta pay - she can not be without oxygen and monitoring for any length of time right now, at any time she could tire out, have a respiratory arrest, and die. 

I can’t overstate this enough, she needs treatment."
3216,"We are seeing very sick children right now with pneumonia on top of flu. It is bad, bad, bad across the country.

The triad of low oxygen plus fast respiratory rate plus fatigue/increased work of breathing is what comes before they drop off that cliff. Unfortunately, kids are NOT adults; they exhaust their reserve without many signs that the collapse is immanent. You can't wait until they ""look worse."" This is what they look like when they are in crisis.

Please let them take her to the hospital in the ambulance. Honestly, although triage shouldn't work this way, it may make it even an inch more likely to get the last bed there. The last night I was on call, I spent the next day pulling together the direct line numbers for ""transfer centers"" (or the equivalent) for children's hospitals in the surrounding seven states.

I'd had to call four children's hospitals before I could find one for transfer. Well, one of them would have taken her, but there was a 24 hour wait expected -- and we don't have kid-sized ventilators here. The last time I saw one like this, we did intubate and just tried our best while awaiting transport.

Children's hospitals are in crisis. This is our version of the 2019 surge. RSV and flu are hitting hard, and COVID is still there, but it's the secondary pneumonias that are doing them in. Check out the nursing subreddit. Nurses without experience in pediatrics are being pulled in, including to NICUs and PICUs.

The hospital will work with you. There is some specific language to use when asking for aid if you are in that hole between Medicaid and being able to pay. We will help you. Please get her safe.

Edited to add: So very sorry you and she are having to deal with this. It is hard. It is awful to have to choose."
3217,"I’m sorry this is happening to your daughter.

There is no safe option other than the ambulance ride with the oxygen mask.

Speak with the hospital social worker while she is admitted. If you are under a certain income level, it is likely that your daughter will qualify for a state-funded children’s health care plan. If she qualifies, this will be retroactive to the care she is about to receive, since she qualified all along.

If not, ask about applying for charity care/bill forgiveness through the hospital. This option will take perseverance, but there are organizations that can help you advocate for yourself if you get a bill that seems unfair.

Good luck."
3218,"It really makes me sad when cost is a financial barrier to healthcare – I’m sorry to hear your daughter is sick and that the costs are already adding up

An oxygen saturation of 82% is very low, normally we want it in a young healthy child to be at least 97%, ideally higher. Hypoxemia can cause considerable damage to many parts of the body. If she needs to be on an oxygen mask (beyond even nasal prongs) to keep her oxygen levels at normal range, that’s quite serious (even if you feel your daughter currently doesn’t physically appear to look that sick). This is not something that should be managed at an urgent care centre"
3219,I hope your little one gets better!!
3220,So glad to hear she’s doing better. Sounds like her mommy is pretty strong too.
3221,"The wroding the UC used that you ""must"" do XYZ is incorrect. You have the option of driving your child to the hospital yourself but you'll be taking the risk. The chance that your child will get super sick with you taking her or an ambulance taking her is low. 

As for whether you need to go to the hospital, that's harder to know without seeing the child. Statistically most transfers of such sort are to prevent you from suiting the doctor afterward when shit goes wrong. And yes, people sue their doctors when we don't take every possible last resort to prevent something even remotely from happening. 

If my child can maintain her oxygen and stay hydrated at home and there is no signs of sepsis then I would take my child home and if something goes wrong I would go follow up with a good pediatrician or go back to the urgent care or walk into an ER."
3222,"Thank you for pointing this out. NAD but OP, my college friends and I are in mourning today because we lost our lovely, healthy 42 year old friend last night to pneumonia complications from Flu. She went from fine on Tuesday to intubated on life support by Thursday. Please listens to the doctors. Have her transferred however they think is most likely to keep her comfortable and more importantly, safe. Im sorry insurance is an issue for you here. I see lots of other great comments helping on that issue."
3223,"Thank you for the info. Some of this I did not realize until it was almost too late. I truly thought she just had the flu. I’m so glad I decided to bring her to urgent care. Now I know what signs to watch for in the future and to take action vs waiting it out a little. That can be the difference between life and death. I feel so guilty that I didn’t bring her in sooner, but I’m just thankful she’s going to be okay and she’s in great care.

Are you able to elaborate a little on the language I should use when I ask for aid? I’ve heard this elsewhere too that they won’t offer it, you have to specifically ask."
3224,"What a sweet spirit you have. I’d wager a limb that you’re an excellent doctor, driven by an actual desire to fix all the boo-boos. 

Thank you for the clear language and for sounding the alarm (and for likely working too long & hard at times like this). I had no idea about the crisis, but I’ll spread the word now.

Hang in there. You are needed and appreciated."
3225,"One of my doctors offices is inside a hospital building and they are not letting kids inside to visit and they are screening people coming in for signs of illness. 

I know so many*adults* who have picked up illnesses from kids already this year and yes that's usually normal but it's usually minor colds and these are 1-3 week long knock out drag out fights of illnesses. 

RSV and the flu are kicking hospitals asses. They need to get back out there and start telling people if you feel sick stay home and if you need to go out wear a mask (because people feel like they don't need to anymore because they are covid vaccinated) 

And I know we are all sick of covid but if there's anywhere that is dealing with this and gets a really bad surge this winter it's going to be an absolute catastrophe. 

I don't say that to be a doomer, I say that because I can see the large and very well staffed urgent care and hospital times around me being crazy during slow times for example. I can see the measures my hospitals are putting into place. 

This is my first large Thanksgiving dinner in a couple years (none other than my husband in 2020, like 5 people 2021). I don't want to not be able to have a Christmas dinner this year, so I'm certainly not doomering it. I wish there was more out there as far as PSAs"
3226,"Why is it that we are seeing such high rates of rsv and flu? Is this only in children or also adults? Is it that there are many more infected, or are the symptoms/the virus worse/stronger than in previous years and it makes them more sick?"
3227,"I’ll add that I’m a medical coder and part of what I do is assist patients with high medical bills and attempt to get them written off or reduced. 

Op, it’s likely you can get those Medicals waived or reduced. Medicaid usually has a 90 day retroactive look back on claims. Most people on unemployment also are usually eligible for snap as well. With the federal boosters in place, that might also give you some breathing room as well."
3228,"At the hospital, your daughter may qualify for Medicaid, and there should be a person who can help with the application. I can’t speak for TX, but the 2 states I’ve worked in, Medicaid is retroactive to the beginning of the month, so if she qualifies, the hospital stay and the urgent care visit will be covered. I don’t want to get your hopes up, but I do want you to know that hospitals work with uninsured people every day and there are people employed by the hospital to help you with this."
3229,"The following is not my comment but I saw it elsewhere on Reddit today. Sorry, I don’t have the redditor’s name. 

Hey sweetie I negotiate hospital bills for a living. I want to let you know that what you’re feeling is normal, but only because people don’t understand how not serious this is. So take a few deep breaths and let me explain…

Insurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf. We frequently gets these bills reduced by 40, 50, 60%. This has caused providers to pad their bills, knowing they will only receive a small portion. That, plus all the uninsured folks who never pay, means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic services.

You do not have to pay this bill. Ever. They can’t do anything to you. No one will force you. It will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt. This is America. Literally everyone has medical debt. It won’t stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house. It doesn’t make a difference.

In a few years, the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar. Then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times, trying to settle with you. At this point, if you want to settle, offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full. They will likely take it.

If you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you’re making the payments, it won’t get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).

Please don’t do anything drastic. The system is fucked and it’s supposed to make you scared and nervous so that you sell your baby to pay the bills. In the end, the hospital knows they have no leverage against you so they want to make everything complicated and intimidating. Don’t let them win. You got this."
3230,"Not OP, but can I ask a related question? My son is 3.5yo and has asthma. He usually sits about 98% when healthy and not having an asthma flare. When he's sick, without an active asthma attack he generally ranges 94% but has dropped as low as 87%. We've been told to take him to the emergency room when he drops to 89% or lower... but is it safe for him to be 90-93% staying home in bed whenever he's sick? Because as of right now, that's currently what's happening."
3231,">It really makes me sad when cost is a financial barrier to healthcare

Even more so when it's access for a child. A child is not responsible for their parents ability to pay insurance."
3232,My mom got hypoxemia from pneumonia I never understood what happened to her she was 80 😭
3233,"I was an EMT and a pre-med student one semester from my degree before my body finally tried to give up on me. I wanted to be a doctor so badly but I never understood the cost of healthcare in the US until I was on the other side. 

Starting when I was 17 and continuing throughout the entirety of college I had pyelonephritis over and over again, multiple instances of sepsis, kidney failure you name it. In my entire life I have never been uninsured and never had lower than “gold” level “amazing insurance”. 

My accountant friend sat down with me and we got to $2 million dollars before we gave up adding the rest of the medical bills. I can’t even file for bankruptcy because there would be no point because it’s not something that will go away. 

And this is with me being insured…I can’t even imagine someone in a similar situation without insurance. 

It’s so wrong that people like OP even have to be worried about the financial cost of healthcare."
3234,"Thank you ❤️ she is, slowly but surely."
3235,Thank you ❤️ We are almost through it!
3236,"Read the post more carefully, this is not a case where we can do some equivocating on the internet.

If this parent took the uncertainty in your response to heart and chose to take them home, there's a good chance the kid would die or be even sicker when they end up having to go to the hospital. Your colleagues in the urgent care HAVE seen her and want her transferred, that should be enough for you to wholeheartedly endorse the necessity of a transfer for a kid with an O2 sat of 82% on room air."
3237,The kids room air SpO2 was 82%. I’m no pediatrician but that seems like a slam dunk hospitalization to me.
3238,"Rapid respiratory rate with a pulse oximetry on room air of 82% in a young child is pretty concerning. We can’t see the child so it’s hard to say how difficult their respiratory effort is. I don’t know how far the hospital is, but the possibility the child may worsen during the drive exists. That’s your choice to make, but I my mind the ambulance ride makes sense. 
I would speak to the hospital admissions folks about applying for Medicaid for your child, as someone stated earlier, it will be retroactive to the beginning of the month."
3239,"To leave and go home would definitely be against medical advice, and signing out a child in acute hypoxic respiratory failure would immediately provoke a report to child protective services."
3240,"Read the post again. The only options in this case are an ambulance to the hospital or a call to CPS followed by an ambulance to the hospital.

I'm frankly shocked that the urgent care is holding onto the kid long enough for op to make a reddit post about it."
3241,I am so sorry to hear about your loss. I have taken all the advice to heart and followed the instructions to get my daughter the care she needs.
3242,"For anyone reading, there is no such thing as 'just' the flu. Influenza kills thousands of people, mostly children and the elderly. 

Get your bloody flu shots people."
3243,"Might I suggest you check out NBCs national news each night.  They have been covering the convergence of the flu & RSV for quite awhile. They even showed Texas Children being almost out of beds awhile back.  

The situation for sick kids is very serious.  They have interviewed a lot of families that had no idea RSV was so bad.  They also showed kids with RSV & their chests as they were breathing before they went to the hospital.  

(Sick kids are always at the top of the program, so you don’t have to watch the entire national news, if you don’t want.)

(Please don’t take any offense by this.  I’m just trying to suggest a good, easy to access source for solid information about childhood diseases that are spreading like wildfire right now.)"
3244,"I had no idea it was so bad and it kinds worries me. I'm a daycare teacher and almost all of my kids started getting sick a week ago. My coteacher and I started getting sick last Wednesday,  scratchy throat and we sounded congested but otherwise we both felt fine. Well Saturday hit and things got my bad. I'm coughing so hard the muscles in my stomach hurt. I cough so hard i can't breathe.  It's been a seriously awful weekend. My husband but the humidifier next to the bed and that's starting to help and even thought maybe I could go to work today (we are extremely short staffed) but i don't want to spread anything, especially if this is very hard on children"
3245,"Also, most places will let you set up a payment plan. I had a friend who paid $10 month for 2 years until the bill was settled. It's horrible that finances dictate the amount of health care a person can access.  Please take the ambulance!"
3246,"Adding onto this, many hospitals will work with families to come up with a payment plan. 

I'm not a doc, but have a child who's had pneumonia nearly 2 dozen times plus a scary incidence of RSV. 82% oxygen is very low. Please listen to the urgent care docs, and deal with the financial side of things later. Like the person above said, there are people at the hospital whose job it is to help uninsured people navigate the financial side of things."
3247,"Hospital social worker can help you apply for financial assistance including the hospital's own charitable fund and outside funding  like Medicaid. 


Your daughter needs to be treated so she doesn't get a brain injury from oxygen deprivation. It scrambles your brain, so even when you have all the information you need to make a decision, your brain has trouble finding the info and understanding the consequences of your actions. 


Speaking from experience, Im 15 years post oxygen deprivation & still need 22-24 hour direct supervision because I keep having preventable accidents"
3248,"Former Texas Medicaid caseworker here and OP if you see this, you can apply for coverage beginning this month, but also for three months prior should you need it.  You should be able to apply online at the Your Texas Benefits website (or app)."
3249,"Texas medicaid system is horrifically low for income guidelines. Massive hole of people that make too much for medicaid but not enough to afford treatment. Texas has some of the lowest income limits for medicaid, something insanely ridiculous like 17% of the FPL. (Basically, unless you have no income, you are not getting medicaid, sadly) Compare this to NYS, which allows medicaid for up to 138% of FPL"
3250,"I’m a coder. I’ve seen retroactive Medicaid for up to 90 days. That usually isn’t that hard to get. It just depends on what claims are available. I had a friend that had mental crisis in April and late May. I was able to get both hospital encounters covered, and the ambulance. He hadn’t gotten healthcare in over 10 years. He’s now on Medicaid and is starting to get the care that he needs. He is so much more stable than he was then."
3251,Thank you so much for this!
3252,"I have a slight bone to pick with this, I work in medical billing (in TX) and many facilities have caught on to the procedure this comment describes. Therefore, many are forcing autopay, with a minimum monthly payment that theyll accept. For example, my last hospital bill was $1100 after insurance, and they would not take less than $40 a month, otherwise they will automatically report to collections. It’s a dirty business, so hopefully OP has much better luck."
3253,they still report it to my credit report as regular debt and when i challenge it they sue me
3254,"Great info, very interesting.   When did you read this comment elsewhere, today?   I'd like to see the responses to this...I've read stories about people going bankrupt over medical debt...I wonder if it depends on the state?"
3255,"NAD but have bronchial asthma (basically asthma that kicks in when I’m sick), and it runs in my family - my brother does have full blown asthma. 

I can’t give solid advice like doctors on here, but I can tell you that if it stays in that low range (90 or under for longer than a few hours): A) you need to be treating him with the albuterol nebulizer machine as prescribed to open up his airways - do you have a nebulizer machine at home? It’s a must for anyone with asthma. B) if the nebulizer isn’t bringing up his numbers, or if you don’t have a nebulizer and his numbers stay that low for a while, it’s best to take him in. Reason for this is that his low blood oxygen is depriving his tissues and organs of necessary oxygen to sustain themself; meaning long term can have bad consequences. With that being said, when the o2 is that low, it makes your heart work faster to keep up with the lack of oxygen that the blood isn’t giving.

If it were me in your situation, if I couldn’t get his numbers up with lying still and albuterol treatments, I wouldn’t let it go on for more than an hour or two. 

And, regardless of the number, even if it’s 94% but you notice any blue tinging to the lips or fingers or toes, get him in PRONTO."
3256,"It is.


The kid is in acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia.  I have no idea why a verified physician on this sub would suggest any possibility other than transport by ambulance and admission.


Yeah, I suppose “Leave AMA and have your child potentially die…” is always an option a parent could make.  However that’s not the advice people usually look for on this sub."
3257,[deleted]
3258,Agreed. 100% accurate. If a child is desating off of supplemental O2 or in resp distress before discharge then you'd be correct. But either I didn't read and reread the OPs information wrong or others didn't pay attention to what I wrote or possibly got triggered because anything against AMA certainly carries an emotional charge for us as physicians.
3259,Thank you. Just a total shock to see someone so healthy be taken down so quickly. Hope your daughter has a swift recovery.
3260,Search the hospital's charity care policies to see if your income qualifies you for free care for her!
3261,Please remember kids compensate until they do not. And they may look fine up until they are not. Pediatrics is a whole different animal. Thank you for listening to the advice here
3262,I hope your daughter heals soon! I know it can be hard on the entire family when someone is this sick.
3263,"You can also talk to a social worker at a hospital who can help you get coverage for your daughter. She most likely qualifies for Medicaid and this should be covered, but a social worker can help"
3264,"That’s where I messed up. She’s never had the flu, and I’ve only had it once. Others in my family recovered quickly, children and adults. I had no frame of reference really. I will never make this mistake again and we will be getting flu shots religiously going forward. In fact her doctor said it’s not too late to get one after she’s fully recovered."
3265,"Thank you doctor.  So many people say,  ""I was out of work yesterday because I had the flu""  no you didn't! If you are here now,  you had a cold.  My doctor explained it to me,  ""if you are lying in bed sick and someone tells you that there is a 100 dollar bill on your porch, if you get up and get it,  you DON'T have the flu. """
3266,"You may suggest it, but I’ll pass. I was once a news junkie. Then Trump happened, and I was increasingly depressed, eventually -due to reasons beyond current events exacerbating the situation- I was suicidal. Two letters written, one to go, and detailed plan in place. But it turns out there’s no letter good enough for your child. So, I decided to make some changes to see if they’d help. One of those changes was to stop watching and reading so much news. Now I’m a less informed but much happier living person. We’re all different friend, and I literally couldn’t handle it and also remain mentally and emotionally healthy for my family. So I did what I needed to do."
3267,That’s true. I don’t particularly like doing only payment plans unless there are absolute certain chances of repayment because normally people are struggling and splitting it up isn’t always helpful.
3268,Thank you. The hospital staff also gave me a packet to apply for Medicaid so I am definitely doing that.
3269,"Th reason for this is that Texas is one of eleven states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid. 

[https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/)"
3270,The current Texas Medicaid income guidelines show 144% FPL for Medicaid for a child in a family of two. Texas is pretty terrible but the federal government makes the children's Medicaid guidelines.
3271,"It’s a *little* better for children than it is for adults in TX.  You can be on SSDI & if you have savings, you are disqualified from so many supplemental programs.  At least they raised the income level from $17,000/yr."
3272,I also recommend asking about the hospital system’s charity care. I’m a social worker and I’ve helped patients complete this paperwork.
3273,"Yeah the ""hey sweetie"" person is full of crap. Truth is it financially ruins families and they go into 20 year financial black holes where they have no quality of life and barely survive. Going to the ed and getting admitted is a death sentence for someone. Usually it takes multiple visits. Here anyway they would have turned away the child for breathing through the mask and billed the family 10k for their time, after a 20 hour wait. The ""it doesnt affect you"" comment on collections just means they cant buy a house or finance a car ever again, so theyll pay triple in rent on at buy here pay here's and be poor forever. On the other hand, if they dont take them, they will get life in prison if death occurs."
3274,Yeah I thought medical debt was the biggest reason for bankruptcy in the US. Are all those people just handling it wrong?
3275,"We haven't been given a nebulizer. I'm going to ask about one at his next appointment at the asthma clinic here. He has a maintenance steroid inhaler and an emergency Ventolin inhaler. We've gone to the ER with a steady low 90s oxygen and they will only anything if he is wheezing or having labored breathing. If he's sitting at 91-93% with no wheeze or obvious distress they send us home! Last time we went he was at 92-93% the entire time during triage, and they could hear a wheeze in the lungs. He wasn't monitored in the waiting room. And when we saw the doctor, they prescribed oral prednisone and sent him home- no ventolin or ANY treatment."
3276,"Given that we're opining over the internet, and the UC physician has seen and assessed IRL and wants to transfer, I think it's inappropriate to introduce doubt in this case. Even though, yes, what you're saying is totally reasonable, laypeople on the internet often don't have the ability to understand the nuance that you're trying to provide. This person is at risk of making a very bad decision.

If you got this call from a non-medical family friend: My daughter is hypoxic, has a fast resp rate, has a known pneumonia, should I bring them into the ED for assessment... what would your response be? Would you do some BS equivocating about the reliability of the sat probe or would you just tell them to bring them in? Add to that the UC physician wants to transfer them to your hospital... would you decline the transfer? Fuck no you wouldn't, so why introduce doubt on the necessity of transfer in this case.

The correct answer of the binary yes or no: Given the information in the post, should this child be transferred to the ED is obviously yes."
3277,...but why take that chance? If SPO2 is reading 82% at a medical facility and the patient has been symptomatic for days then that should be taken seriously until vitals are otherwise recorded. She should not be blown off simply because you happen to see some children have different vitals upon arrival to ED sometimes.
3278,Doing this now!
3279,"That is the biggest lesson I have learned throughout this ordeal - they might look fine until they’re not, and it can become a life threatening situation very quickly. I will never second guess myself again when it comes to her health. I thought about taking her to urgent care the day before and I should have. Thankfully we still made it in time. A child’s health cannot be taken lightly and I would literally die myself without her. Advice is what I came here for and I’m so grateful to everyone who provided insight and knowledge that I didn’t have before."
3280,Thank you ❤️ it’s slow progress but still progress! Hoping to go home tomorrow.
3281,"It is definitely worth getting it. Even if she does have influenza, and not one of the other nasty viral infections out there, there are several types of flu you can get. The shots contain scientist's best guesses as to which kinds are going to circulate any given season, and this year, the shot includes 4 types. If she got one now, she can still get the other 3."
3282,"Thank you for learning and the update.  Breathing things with kids get so scary so fast. I grew up poor and asthmatic in a family of asthmatics- we all learned this too.  My brother ended up hospitalized over a week as a kid for something that started small and then turned into double pneumonia and bronchitis by the time it was done.

I’m so, so glad you came here and listened.  (I tend to get the flu yearly, and bad, even with the flu shot.  Without the flu shot, I get it even worse.  I’ve gotten multiple strains in a year so many times.  My immune system is shit.  As a kid the flu was hell on earth.  It always amazes me that it doesn’t hit everyone like that!)

Thank you for listening and learning again, it makes such a difference!"
3283,Definitely get it to keep her safe through the winter
3284,"People in your family may not have had the flu.  People say ""I had the flu"" all the time when they just had other colds and viruses"
3285,[removed]
3286,I’m glad you’re still with us ❤️
3287,"I’m sorry you went through that.  A lot of ppl had a very hard time during 2020 losing family to Covid & a man in power saying it didn’t exist.  I had to get off social media where my “friends” were.  

You need to know when there are health crisis’ with children.  Texas Children in Houston had zero beds available at one point due to RSV & flu in the last month. 

Maybe work on culling the information, so it’s not so overwhelming. NBC is good about giving you headlines prior to the program.  Plus, sick kid news is at the top of the program.  Or perhaps check Texas Children’s website to see what’s happening now w children’s health. 

I’m glad your baby is getting good care now & I wish you the best.  Take care of yourself & your precious one!  ♥️"
3288,"Yes, this was a deliberate choice."
3289,"I was afraid of that. I was hopeful, that at least all children would get coverage…because they’re kids. But I guess OP’s 6yo should just get a job with benefits."
3290,Pro life!
3291,"And yet somehow Abbott was still voted in. Makes
me sick 😔"
3292,"Texans can thank Governor Abbott for refusing federal tax dollars just to prove he is an anti-tax  Republican.

Texans pay taxes; they should get benefits when they need them."
3293,"At the moment I have zero income until I start my new job, so hopefully there are no “rules” that exclude me from receiving aid because I was recently employed and will be again in the near future. I’m not sure how it all works but I’ll be talking to the financial advisor about my options."
3294,I will be speaking with someone in the morning about financial assistance and will ask about this. Thank you!
3295,"You’re kidding - they don’t even give a nebulizer treatment? My brother used to have horrible attacks all the time, and the first thing they did was give him “the tube” to breathe into, even though we had been doing it at home before deciding to take him in. It was their way to gauge to see if the albuterol had any effect before breaking out the big guns. 

I’d definitely ask - if not insist on getting a nebulizer machine for at home if this is chronic (which it sounds like it is). You can buy the machines outright, but still need the prescription for the medication to put in it. 

Inhalers are good to have, too, but unless things have changed significantly in the last ten years or so since we’ve dealt with it, albuterol was always the first thing the doctors turned to, here in Michigan anyways."
3296,"I just want to add, that children’s hospitals have amazing financial programs. This same thing happened to my daughter when she was about 18 months old. She spent 2 nights at the children’s hospital and was fine. CHKD hospital had a tiered system of knocking off 25% 50% 75% or 100% off the bill. We qualified for 75% off, which made the total like $300. The ambulance ride from the pediatrician to the hospital was a turd to deal with, but after at least 3 calls to both my insurance and the ambulance company they finally coded it right or something and I only paid $70. 

Now that I’m a stay at home parent our bills from chkd are 100% discounted and i dont even get bills anymore. I hope your little one feels better soon."
3297,I’m so glad you listened and got her in. 💜
3298,"Oh my gosh how scary!!! That must have taken such a toll on you and your family. Asthma and the flu sounds like an absolute nightmare.

3309,"I’m sorry your daughter had a hospital stay so young, but I’m glad things worked out well for you financially. This is encouraging for me. Our hospital offers the same tiered system, and I will find out more today about what I qualify for. I might not have much luck with the ambulance. I don’t have insurance and it’s a private company. But will certainly try though!"
3310,"No, I know who I was responding to.  I’m *hoping* that /u/FinalOstrich8235 can check back in to the world now that Trump has been gone 2 yrs & maybe check the news.  She’s got kids; she knows how important she is to those kids.  It might behoove her to know there’s an epidemic of RSV & flu, hospitals don’t have children’s beds & maybe she’ll get her kid a flu shot.  

But, thanks for you’re oh so welcomed, & kind!, input.  Buh bye👋

ETA duuude."
3311,"CHIP, [Children’s Health Insurance Plan](https://www.texaschildrenshealthplan.org/what-we-offer/chip) is available for kids in Texas.  Someone mentioned it to OP in a post higher up."
3312,"Exactly! That’s the problem with kids these days, they want everything handed to them. Not willing to pull themselves up!"
3313,"Yeah, because kids don't require healthy parents to take care of them, lol."
3314,I am looking into this too! :)
3315,It’s Texas Children’s Hospital. I cannot even imagine her hospital stay being so costly. I am sincerely hoping I can utilize the resources available so I don’t drown in debt from this.
3316,"One kid. Now 19, at a top tier college. Deans list. Poli-sci major. Well informed. Politically active. Fully vaccinated. I hope you can sleep now."
3317,There are other ways to learn these things. I don’t watch that crap and I knew about that. How on earth do you know whether this person has gotten their child a flu shot?! Worry about yourself and stop badgering strangers on the internet.
3318,"Bravo!!!  Very happy for you & your kid!  How proud you must be!  It’s not easy to raise kids, sounds like you did a good job.  💪👏👏👏
(No sarcasm)"
3319,"It’s ridiculous how proud I am. I could burst. His heart is even better than his brain. I didn’t even mention the job he landed writing for the school paper, or that his article bested the long-standing most read ever, earning him a celebration with cake at work last week. Or his comp-sci minor that’s so math heavy it gives me anxiety for him. Or that he’s the sweetest older cousin anyone could ever have - so patient and loving. He is the absolute best, which is why I didn’t have another. Can you imagine the therapy bill: “why can’t you be more like your brother?!” And thank you for the kind words as well as the opportunity to brag about my boy. 💜"
3320,"it is the flu 

BIRD FLU"
3321,"I thought i had covid or the flu, I just tested negative for both but am still sick as a dog."
3322,People make a big deal out of every new virus with even a remotely sizeable outbreak and only one has resulted in a global pandemic in the last hundred years
3323,HMPV isn't new. China's just having a local epidemic. I work as a CNA and HMPV unfortunately makes the rounds every flu season.
3324,how tf do people keep getting new diseases. like wtf are yall even doing? shitting in the soup?
3325,"Hahahahahaha

What middle class?"
3326,Guys chill out the next pandemic will be in 2119
3327,Its
3328,Isn't it known since 2001?
3329, No such thing as the middle class but yes
3330,When are we finally gonna get something cool like a zombie virus? I wanna be a zombie. I'm fed up with work.
3331,we can't rest
3332,"As a gaming social worker, I miss covid. My job was easy. The roads were empty. Suddenly all the lost mates in MMOs and discord popped up again. I have enough games and boardgames to last me a lifetime to complete so let's go."
3333,They tried the same with Monkeypox. Got to be more original to scare people in current year smh
3334,"""QUICK, FEARMONGER. WORRY THE MASSES SO THEY STOP TRYING TO EAT THE RICH.""

People really are just so stupid they'll eat up anything and everything. It's basically a common cold, by the way."

3336,Round 2 😁👍
3337,"I would think it’s just one of the old style the next big one viruses which in pathology we would see regularly before COVID that we freak out about and national
Health agencies do, but doesn’t gain traction like COVID did.

It better be anyway, as quite frankly if we have another pandemic I’m resigning from my position in microbiology, screw 15 years in that field not going through that turd wagon again."
3338,Won’t get fooled again
3339,bird up
3340,"HMPV is a different flu, H5N1 is the recent bird flu, we've got two different flu types floating about causing issues."
3341,"Bird flu?





Yeah they tend to do that"
3342,So... You believe in birds uh?
3343,"You know that Covid existed before as well?
Cov-19 is just a variant thats stronger than usual. Like this flu. It's not just a flu, it will be harder to recover from and hence a bigger threat"
3344,"dog flu, there you go. that'll be $59000 please."
3345,AIDS
3346,"Yeah, science has been concerned about a variety of bird and swine influenzas for at least the past 20 years, and none had near the impact that Covid did."
3347,"Lol, I remember reading a news article about a new virus found in Asia a few years ago.

Me and my colleagues joked about it and said it wouldn't affect us

And then everything went to shit"
3348,"Apparently this strain has ""covid like"" qualities. Loss of taste, smell, neurological effects, etc."
3349,Shut the actual fuck up. Seriously.
3350,Wanna hit this ranch?

3352,ya boobay
3353,HMPV is not a different flu because HMPV isn't caused by a virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family which means STRAIGHT MUCUS virus but instead viruses from the family Pneumoviridae which means STINKY POISON SLIME virus. Interestingly enough the current outbreak of HMPV in china is a mutated variety that shares characteristics with the Avian variety of metapneumovirus AMPV and has the potential to hybridize with bird flu to make it have an estimated 60x more affinity for human cells.
3354,Wow almost like always but since covid NOW everyone cares.
3355,"The same virus was known since 2004 and everyone was just okay with it even though the people researching it said ""hey this can be a bad thing in the future""."
3356,"I remember reading articles about Swine Flu, Ebola, and Zika

And then nothing happened"
3357,"Don’t tell me what to do, nerd"
3358,TIME FOR SOME RANCH!!!!
3359,Pneumo means air or lung.
3360,"Well, the H5N1 flu could be a massive problem if it mutates the ability to transfer from person to person, though, thanks to Covid countries seem more aware of viruses, so for example, the UK is already getting vaccines in place should H5N1 become an issue.

As for the HMPV, we don't know the full details, it seems like a major problem in China, but the Chinese government is downplaying how bad it is, which they always do, so it could be a small or massive problem, hard to tell due to the CCP propaganda machine."
3361,it becomes a problem to people only when their local store and McDonalds shuts down
3362,Bc we had a swift hard reaction. Never know with the next administration.
3363,I Just did.
3364,Sup Mello
3365,Pneumo means lung in greek but in latin which is the proper usage in the context of taxonomy means poison or stinky slime.
3366,I watched videos out of China before Covid got out. They did NOT downplay that virus on their own soil. Maybe internationally but the videos showed an entirely different picture.
3367,"Good, at least we have an entering president who will cut flights from China. After the botched covid vaccine and all the people i know who have died from heart complications after getting said vaccine, I'd rather be ultra careful until this shit is tried and tested. Glad i never got covid or the vaccine."
3368,As long as they leave Arby’s alone.
3369,Stop disobeying me. Daddy will punish you.
3370,That is incorrect. The name is derived from the Greek root word due to the type of diseases caused by them. See 'Derivation of names' in the [ICTV report](https://ictv.global/report/chapter/pneumoviridae/pneumoviridae).
3371,All the people you know died from the Covid vaccine? Lmao yeah sure buddy
3372,"Botched vaccine? What exactly is your definition of botched? Most people who got it had nothing happen, and you’re sure those people already on the chopping block?"
3373,You mean like how he closed the country down last time he was in office? The beginning of Covid *was* his to deal with.
3374,"Look it up, early vaccination caused heart issues in younger men. 3 people i know personally, who were perfectly healthy had to have some sort of heart operation recently, so they either were struck by luck or logic. Look it up instead of ""Lil bro""-ing me.

I'm not anti Vax. But holy fucking shit, idk how people can agree that a virus can be made in a lab but when you mention that a HASTILY MADE VACCINE could have health complications, you're a crazy person. 

Never told anyone not to get it, never spread misinformation, only going off of reports, data and personal experiences.

Vaccines are amazing but when ""the right one"" magically pops up, very rapidly I might add, yeah it's normal for people to be skeptical. 

Idgaf about downvotes or the ""buddy"" comments, do your own research."
3375,I said what I said. There was nothing behind it. Other than maybe if we had 4 more years of Biden he'd probably forget it broke out for a few days and then close things up. Lol
3376,"First of all, that's not what you said. You literally said everyone you know died of the vaccine. If that isn't misinformation and fear mongering then I don't know what is.

Second, the reason this vaccine was created to swiftly was because it was a *global* effort. This was the first time the entire world simultaneously focussed all their efforts on one vaccine. No shit it got done quick.

Third, I'll trust literally every scientist that actually knows what they're talking about instead of random people spewing bullshit, thanks."

3384,"Dude metapneumovirus has been going around India for decades. It's nothing new, we are only worried about a new variant and even that will be treated like any other viral infections. 

Let's just wait and see how the new virus is behaving. I wouldn't trust china with their suppressed research. Please be patient and don't spread any unnecessary panic at this point of time."
3385,"If reports are true that in China this new virus (media reports saying HMPV) is spreading rapidly then there are definitely some substance to it either it is new variant which spreads rapidly or altogether novel virus can't say anything with china.

Baaki HMPV is been all over the world including India for decades toh abhi koi test krke hmpv nikal rha hai toh isme nya kuch nhi hai."

3410,"bro , same thing was said for COViD, that SARS existed for decades. However, the thing is if something which existed for decades how does it cause an outbreak?

Sars itself has mutated over the years, thus rises the question of hmpv mutation increasing its virulence. Which strain HMPV is causing outbreak is yet to be clarified"

3520,"Según lo que leí en una búsqueda rápida de internet, el HPMV fue identificado por primera vez en 2001 en Países Bajos, es un virus que se propaga a través del contacto directo con personas ya infectadas o por contacto con superficies contaminadas, similar a otros virus respiratorios como el Covid-19. Además, causa síntomas similares al resfriado común, y cuando se complica, puede desencadenar en bronquitis o neumonía.

De todas maneras no es un virus nuevo y los 'expertos' dicen que no hay que alarmarse. Las autoridades chinas aseguran que la situación está bajo control."

Ya se muy controversial pero me dio fantasía decirlo."
3581,"Cuando decís algo "" raro"" hacemos guiño-guiño y significa armas biologicas diseñadas en laboratorios no??"
3582,Otra cosa q me pregunto. El covid no atacó a los indios?
3583,"Lo que sucede q diferencia de India es que los chinos ahora tienen plata y viajan bastante. Además muchos van a china a hacer negocios, entonces eso fomenta abundante la transmisión de enfermedades."
3584,Quizas quieren matar a la gente vieja para no pagarles la jubilacion.
3585,"Flaco los chinos DESCUBREN las enfermedades. No (necesariamente) las generan. Lo mismo paso con la gripe ""Española"" que se generó en los EEUU. Los indios deben estar recontra llenos de pestes pero no las investigan/descubren.

Btw esto no es por defender a china porque son un desastre en un monton de cosas, pero este tema me hierve la sangre. Los locos descubren algo sobre lo que tenemos que tener precaución, y se comen el garrón como si lo hubieran generado ellos."

3588,"El tema es que los chinos se mueven mucho más por temas de comercio internacional y turismo y todo eso. Los primeros casos de COVID en Italia se dieron por un grupo de empresarios chinos que estaban de viaje ahí.

Es posible que en la India haya hasta más enfermedades, pero como son poblaciones más ""aisladas"" (muchas comillas), no salen de la zona donde se producen."
3589,Que todo es mentira?

3598,"Si amigo ya sé que la enfermedad no es Coronavirus (igual tampoco es COVID si nos ponemos asi, es COVID-19), pero justamente yo hablaba de q se había anunciado varias veces q se había encontrado un nuevo VIRUS en China desde la pandemia.

Lo otro ni me voy a molestar, bolazo de falopero. Lo que sí, no es tan raro que surjan tantos virus de China por la poca higiene que hay (si se come frecuentemente sopa de murciélago, imaginate), la altísima densidad de población, y demás factores de la idiosincrasia de China."

Y la higiene en China si es muy mala, el coronavirus surgió por un murciélago que tenía el virus y que fue consumido por un humano. A qué conclusión se llega? Que las prácticas de higiene en China no son correctas, en muchos casos las carnicerías tienen la carne al aire libre y sin refrigerar.

3653,Claro y tenía la puerta cerrada de adentro
3654,"Eso es verdad, pero ahí hay dos cosas que no se están teniendo en cuenta: 

1- El covid ahora mismo mata menos gente, precisamente por la campaña que se hizo para vacunar a una gran parte de la población.

2- La cuarentena fue porque no se tenía idea de lo que podía hacer el virus. Teníamos un desconocimiento total: Solo sabíamos que daba síntomas de gripe, que estaba matando gente y que era extremadamente contagioso. Nada más. Todo lo que sabemos ahora se fue dando con el tiempo."
3655,"Primero: Fuente?

Segundo, dale, cabeza. No te calentés, está bien estar errado. ""Mirá, viste este accidentado? Mirá las marcas que le dejó tu amado cinturón de seguridad, hay que ser ignorante para no ver el daño que hicieron esas telitas experimentales"".

Qué daño? Y no me vale el ""No porque Juancito dijo que hacen mal"". Un gran porcentaje de la población está vacunada, si está tan claro el daño que hacen, quiero ver pruebas (porque si fuera como decís, imposible que no las haya)."
3656,Fuente?
3657,"1ero. No estuve encerrado. Yo salía todo el tiempo, incluso tomaba mate con otras personas.
2do. El virus fue real,loq ue yo digo es que no fue tan grave la situación, fue una campaña para meter miedo, por esono me vacuné.
3ero. Se que es mentira pq los paises que no hicieron aislamiento y no obligaron a vacunarse (como Brasil) tuvieron la misma proporción de supuestas muertes por covid que los paises que cerraron y prohibieron toda actividad y contacto.
4to. La pregunta sobre ser doctor no tiene sentido, ya que: a) la mayoría de los médicos son simples técnicos que aplican lo que les enseñaron y los que le dice la oms que deben hacer y b) hay medicos que opinaban una cosa y otros opinanaban exactamente lo contrario"
3658,"Podés buscar las estadísticas por países, todavía están disponibles. Hay tantos datos que seguro no conozcas, principalmente porque si uno mismo no está activamente buscando, los medios principales solo comparten las noticias que les parece más relevantes, tomar en cuenta que es inmenso el mundo para andar compartiendo info de todas partes cuando la prioridad es la región y el país correspondiente del medio.

Edit: Agrego que debido a diversos factores los números están lejos de ser exactos, especialmente en el caso de las muertes. Sea por problemas de organización e infraestructura, por atribuirle la muerte a otros padecimientos, por cuestiones políticas, etc.

como una gripe normal, la gripe mata gente y es contagiosa, después los números de los muertos de covid están inflados, todos morían de covid, bajaron los infartos, bajaron los canceres, todo se anotaba como covid.

3808,"HMPV is not a new virus. It was identified in 2001and is a seasonal virus usually affecting children, older people and immunocompromised populations. This case could very well be a routine infection."
3809,"I don't find any non-Indian news website causing alarm about HPMV. 

Coronavirus was also nothing new either. But covid 19 was a big deal because it was 'novel' coronavirus. 

There is nothing novel about the current HPMV cases. For all you know, most of us here would have already gotten it by now."
3810,“No travel history” “Fully prepared to handle such emergencies “. Where have we heard this before. Hmm
3811,"As an infectious diseases physician in India, this is bull. HMPV has been already seen by many colleagues of mine across India, and this is certainly not new. What we do not know is

1. How common is it this year? We do not routinely test, and since COVID, testing is more common. So, bias is likely.
2. Is it more severe? Not enough data to say so.
3. Is this the same variant as in china? Cannot say. We do not have genomic data on any of the isolates so far.

As of now, no reason to panic, but certainly a need to monitor."
3812,It is not as severe as COVID which was a relatively newly discovered retrovirus. HMPV has been around for years.
3813,"Why is there so much news in India about HMPV? It's a regular seasonal virus. Its getting almost 0 coverage in US.
https://www.livemint.com/science/hmpv-outbreak-in-china-is-it-a-new-virus-how-is-it-similar-to-covid-19-is-there-any-vaccine-what-we-know-so-far/amp-11736044379099.html"
3814,"I just returned from my month long trip to China and HK, and honestly you won’t even know that there’s an “outbreak”. I traveled to 9 cities and there’s absolutely no panic or overwhelmed hospitals.

This is just Indian media trying to increase TRP. As someone pointed out above, this is not a new virus."
3815,"here’s a study from 2007 talking about how common hmpv is in young children: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1831873/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1831873/)

I am not sure how dangerous this variant of virus would be, but many variants of this have been present for long time."
3816,"This is all dumb panic: if you notice it’s only Indian news channels reporting on it, its not something the international media is covering (unlike say Covid)"
3817,yea pretty sure I have this. family came back from Thailand and everyone sick since. Covid like symptoms but more severe. Been 2 weeks of suffering now with fever dreams and debilitating fatigue

Probably because china is facing excessive cases"
3831,Can we find out how many cases of HMPV were found in India in 2023??
3832,"Because China has a severe outbreak (compared to previous years), and so the virus would be a big threat to us as one of its neighbors."

3842,"Absolutely false. The coronaviruses from COVID 19 were novel i.e - never recorded before.

Coronaviruses as a class virus have been studied since a long time."
3843,"Sure coronavirus was not a new virus. But COVID 19 was. There have been no new strains identified of HMPV. 
I would suggest caution anyways ( handwashing, masks if sick) considering now is the season for respiratory infections."

3848,"A simple mask does help, but only if worn correctly. Chin masks and thyroid masks that are used frequently do not help."
3849,"that's very sus with this virus, maybe there is something we don't know yet"
3850,"This is being reported by Indian media. Corrupt Indian media.

What is happening at the moment that they want to distract from?"

3852,Bol mastako ke jhund aaj jung ki ghadi ki tum guhar do
3853,"Exactly my point. It was coronavirus, until it became Novel Coronavirus."
3854,"Um no? Coronavirus was not a new one, COVID 19 was."
3855,"It was never a ""normal"" coronavirus. That's not how this works. When it was first detected, it was clear that it was a new pathogen"
3856,And HMPV is not a novel virus. That's what the other dude is saying.
3857,"And what I am saying is, In Nov, Dec 2019 and Jan 2020, it was just the seasonal flu/coronavirus in China, when in Feb/March everyone realized it was a new strain.

What prevents HMPV going the same route."
3858,"Covid was never a seasonal flu. From the early videos coming out from China, it was always named covid 19. Nobody termed it as a common flu. You can even check the WHO circulars"
3859,"The whole reason there was panic back in Jan 2020 was that this was a novel variant of Coronavirus. Otherwise, it was a non-news simply like the fact that half the people with runny noses in the country are affected by some kind of coronavirus only. Just like always"
3860,You real like being downvoted
3861,"I get that a lot of people might disagree with my stance on HMPV. Honestly, I have no hard feelings towards anyone who thinks differently. I hope the downvotes prove me wrong, and it turns into a story where I was just being overly cautious.

However, I believe that HMPV has the potential to become something much worse. Just like how the coronavirus was initially downplayed and then became a global issue, the same could happen with HMPV. In the next few weeks, we might see it turn into something completely new or a more infectious variant. 

I canceled a family trip to Italy in late February 2020, against everyone’s advice. It was a significant financial loss since most of the expenses were non-refundable, but we avoided a lot of trouble by not traveling.

Just yesterday, I booked another trip, and this morning, I realized I should have waited a few more days. Although it's not as costly, canceling these seven tickets is still an expense I am willing to bear. As before, I am okay with being proven wrong, but I prefer to avoid unnecessary risks based on my previous experiences."

3925,"I've realized that with the stock market, it's never cause and effect.

It's effect and cause."
3926,"Noone is selling due to virus panic. It is just an excuse. FIIs exiting India like they will never return. Market is overvalued, earnings are muted, high inflation, low growth, welfare schemes to buy votes hurting economy. Disastrous finance policies."
3927,"I bought calls today, I'm sure what's gonna happen next."
3928,How are you sure that its the retail investors who are selling and not the institutions or trading firms?
3929,I think today's selling was attributed to weak expectations of upcoming q3 results
3930,"Just so you know, Coronavirus was also a very old virus, Covid19 was a new variant."
3931,This seems to be operator's game. First create panic let retail sell and buy at low and then sell high after few days.
3932,Man inwas hoping to get the work from home
3933,"i closed my positions by 11:30, i knew since friday this would happen on monday, once any case of any flu is detected in india (happens every year during winters in kids), media would take it as COVID AGAIN, since back in 2020 same news cycle started during jan and by feb-mar lockdown were on, fearmoungering would occur and people would panic sell stocks as soon as bank NIFTY shows a correction. 

so whats next, hospitals, doc etc would be on look for new cases, more kids going though usual winter infections would be quarantined , if number of kids increase, market would drop more. Our public is insecure, scared and chicken like, any small news would fear them like crazy, i had never seen more scared and panic public in any other nations, in other countries people are optimistic, here we are pessimist. Im waiting for market to fall a bit again so i can re buy the dip. i work in medical field, daily we see babies getting this or than infection, most of it goes untested, however if we keep testing and look for something in sepecific (HPMW/COVID) we would find it and numbers would grow"
3934,"don't be aggressive buyer, market is expecting a slowdown in economy due to orange man. only unexpected corporate tax cut can prevent a crash. sip in diversified funds is always a better choice."
3935,Sooo true I dunno how come people are panic selling. It shows the stupidity of people. Come on it is just a normal common cold.
3936,"Put the words China and virus together, and people go in a tizzy, without rhyme or reason. This is not just scaremongering but stereotypes and nationalism playing out. The BJP trolls also maximise this: heard from a BJP supporter (a person with good degree) that ""China is doing this all because now Trump is going to come."" What can you expect in India with such minds and such brainwash from the ruling party itself?"

It can go easily as well. You got to be smart and stay invested."

3956,Why panic bocz government not care of general life every country government know if so many cases then health care sector will collapse if that then general public will panic and whole economy will go down .

1. FIIs exiting Indian markets in doves
2. Compromised regulatory agencies especially SEBI
3. Oligarchs, close to dispensation, doing illegal buybacks through shell firms
4. All this has led to irreversible dips in market with FII and sane investors exiting 
5. To cover up the cause and misdirect, the HPMV scare is being floated. There's a reason why just Indian media is floating this like bonkers. Check which oligarchs own these Godi media. The same 2 who allegedly have been manipulating markets through shell companies!"

3963,This scare is real but the media is not revealing
3964,"I sold a significant part of my long term holdings back in July -Aug with the expectation that I will buy them back at a lower price. This is just in case Nimmi increases the ltcg further and I am screwed. I’ve been tracking this on a spreadsheet and guess what, once I factor in the nimmi tax, I’m still not below my sale price. 

Eg sbi sold at 820 but my buy price was 185 so even though it is at 771, I need it to be below 750 to not make a loss on the transaction"

3980,Doing same
3981,"Yeah true. Also i am seeing a trend now in India that market is reacting a bit too fast to any news. I dont think it happened earlier. Its like people sitting on buy and sell buttons and as soon as some news be it hpmv, results come in stocks move like crazy."

3983,"Problem is not with mortality, it's with lockdowns and economic stagnation"
3984,Yeah thats so true. And the major credit goes to media. They make everything look like end of the world scenario.

3990,Well when this hoopla subsides in a day or two and results start coming in which are expected not to be best but better than last quarter then you will be sitting on a pile of cash. Thats what gonna happen next.
3991,I think all were selling today. Retailers alone dont have such kind of firepower to bring down the market.
3992,Oh i thought results gonna be better than last quarter. Also sectors whose results will be great were also part of todays selloff
3993,Covid 19 had very high mortality rate especially during the begining. This one doesnt as far as i have read in news. If something is happening behind the scenes in china then thats a different set of facts i am not aware of.
3994,Looking at thr past 1 month data of nifty you do make sense. We are getting played.
3995,You want a pandemic in country just so you get work from home ?
3996,True we should change our name to panic republic. Stock market reactions to news have gone crazy in India. And you have rightly said that every flu in India is being compared to covid. I though people should have learnt from covid that we will come out strong whatever may come but instead suckers have increased in size in market.
3997,feels like some tax cut are in motion but since its orange tai better to wait till budget and yes SIP is best mode for investment.
3998,Looks like people want some action. Gone are the days where market hardly moved for weeks. Now a 1% percent up and down is normal.

This data that you shared is for immunocompromised patients and hct patients. Hope it helps"
4025,I think we saw trump presidency from miles away and India is kind of isolated from this global weakness and actually that was the usp of Indian markets that they were growing faster than the others. Also i think the nifty did not do justice to the kind of selling that happened today. My portfolio cracked around 5% against niftys 1.8%. Only plausible reason seems to be knee jerk reaction to something which of course comes to hmpv. But yes thats what i think maybe i am wrong. Nobody can actually read the markets correctly.

4055,"Great question. IMHO, global markets are going through a bad patch. Plus, what we're witnessing now is a sell-off that is routine this time of the year. The markets fall on profit-booking. There are no other markets to invest in. A matter of time before the money comes back to India and the indices bounce back. Given where I am though, I'm playing safe and parking only 50% in equities. The others go into bonds, FDs, etc to preserve capital and beat inflation. In the long run, I'm happy with a 15-18% ROI on equity."

4059,"Yeah thats true. I checked the numbers. No one knows why the market fell. People are just creating narratives. Data points don’t add up. DIs have bought more than FIs and Fis sold less than the day before. If it was the virus, then the china or global markets would have also fell"
4060,"Does my statement even make sense to you? Because I am not an investor, I am just trying to state what is obvious to me. Please know I am not a SEBI registered advisor. 

Anyhow, you will have to do your own research, but try to see if glass and pyrex manufacturing companies are down. Technically, when you search for pyrex, these serving bowls with lids will come on. But this is the same thing used for storing medicine in many cases. Similar thing with vials and test tubes. 

Look into Aluminium industry. Say Hindalco, it's around 4% low on YTD, while it closed at 3-ish % lower today as well. Again, I haven't looked at any volumes so can't comment if small investors are panic selling. But a huge part of Aluminium manufacturing is feeding those aluminium sheets for medicine packaging. 

I am NOT saying buy Hindalco. Run your analysis, and see for yourself if any drops you see in these subsidiary industries can be attributed to small time investors bailing out because SENSEX dropped today. Because they are scared of this new virus. If yes, I think we can both assume these can be safe investments in the long term."

4073,IMHO you are missing a lot. Value of stock is directly linked with real value of company and earnings. By holding the stock you hold the piece of company. Sky high valuations without any basis is another thing but stocks arent ponzi scheme because they have real intrinsic value of company attached to it. Thats why rational investors use p/b ratio so that they dont fall into a bubble when bad times come.

Bhai nifty 50 crossed 40 in 2021. Its well below 5 year avg now. Its expensive yeah. Is correction required at this level. No.I think not. 2021 was time for correction. Market is fairly priced IMHO. Earnings in FMCG has not fallen. Look at results of ITC or Tata Consumer. HUL & Dabur could not compete in the market with new age products. Its not slowdown its comptetion from the likes of mamearth, plum nykaa which has taken a huge pie of companies like HUL. Car slowdown was just a temporary thing. Look at the numbers released by Maruti and Mahindra in this quarter. Look at the price of real estate in the country and related data."
4084,I think you should check out comments made by 2 healthcare professionals about this virus.
4085,IMHO it was great indian retail investor panicking. Thats all. Nothing else comes to my mind. Nothing else is on internet also. If this is not the case then it will remain mystery as to who the hell sold this badly when it wasnt institutions.
4086,Oh okay thanks for advice already invested in hindalco will look for glass and pyrex industries.
4087,I didnt mean completely isolated but somewhat isolated since india's growth rate is still quite high compared to other developed countries. And yes that tariff will affect India but not as a whole. Few sectors will be affected but that doesnt mean that we will be seeing a complete selloff in all sectors which is what we saw today.

How does holding a piece of the company benefit me? Do I get a share of the profit? Some companies declare dividends, but many don’t seem to. 

If I get dividends, then I agree with you and my earlier comment will not hold true. If I don’t, what benefit do I have from holding a stock other than selling at a higher price later? The latter sounds more like buying and selling meme coins. "

4101,Mera toh pata nahi par tu bhosdiwaala zaroor hai. The original comment by OP talked about the market reacting “too fast to any news” and the “stocks moving like crazy” then how did you subjectively jump to declaring it is because of 18 year olds with parents’ pocket money panic selling? How’s it even relevant to the markets reacting too fast to any news and the stocks being too volatile?
4102,I am surprised as well bhai..this is new to me. Looks like retail is the new king in markets now.
4103,Bhai meme coins doesnt have any intrinsic value attached to them. Its not backed by anything. Share price of the company is backed by the assets of the company. Real physical assets and intangible assests like brand etc By holding the company you get the benefit when the company does better and stock price rises.

4107,"Hahaha..keeping track. Nobody knows the markets bhai. I only shared my opinion which was based on somebody else opinion which is shared below

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/09/cnbcs-inside-india-newsletter-stocks-have-bottomed-out-heres-what-2025-has-in-store.html"
4108,"Cos that's what happened baby. 12.4k Cr sold by FII, 10.7k Cr sold by DII today.
Sure 16.k Cr was bought by DII too but DIIs selling as much as buying tells enough to extrapolate.

Why are you so hurt? Are you a dumb 18 year old or a smart one?"
4109,"Yeah lol... Still, FIIs have sold some of their holdings. Where can we get data on retail investors transactions?"
4110,">  By holding the company you get the benefit

Can you please be specific about what this benefit is? Dividends is one benefit, but if there is no dividend, then what is it? Name at least one benefit other than selling the stock at a higher price to someone else. 

> stock price rises

For stock price to rise, it needs to be sold at a particular value. For this you need buyers who are ready to buy it at a price higher than what you bought it at. Where does the intrinsic value come into play here? 

Who cares what backs the value of a stock if there’s no benefit to the stock holder other than just being able to sell at a higher price?

If I buy a house, I benefit from its intrinsic value (a place to stay, eat, sleep etc) as well as the potential for a resale value. What’s the intrinsic value of a stock that I get from merely holding and not selling?"
4111,Not bad. Not my best either
4112,You are an idiot for sure for thinking that retail investors are the cause for today's negative market performance.
4113,No idea about retail bhai ...anybody else if knows can shed some light. However you can conclude about the retail portion by looking at thr FII DII data
4114,People buy land and sell it later at high price. People buy gold coins and bars as investment and sell it at high price later. There is a whole business of gold etf and sovereign gold bonds. Do they get anything in the interim. No. Then why do people do that ? Will you call that a ponzi scheme as well ?
4115,"Nahi buy sell pe thodi dependent hai, Modi ji wo keyboard me Nifty ko type kar rahe the."
4116,"With gold, it’s always understood that there will be someone who will accept it as a currency. 

That’s why gold has value. To the ordinary person, the value of gold is what someone is willing to give for it in exchange for it. 

It’s the same with stocks. The worth of a stock is what someone is willing to pay for it when he buys it from you. Who cares what the intrinsic value is, as long as there’s someone to buy it at a higher price?

Fundamental analysis seems like a waste of time, since stock value only seems to come from whatever price someone else is willing to pay to get it from you. 

All this changes if there’s value in having a stock OTHER THAN the increment you get from selling at a higher price. Is there such a value? I don’t know. You tell me. "

4175,"Is HMPV worse than COVID?

Experts say the HMPV outbreak in China is not of major concern — it is neither a new, mystery illness nor responsible for as many cases as COVID or other infections even this season. According to the latest CDC data, HMPV accounts for less than 2% of weekly positive tests of respiratory viruses. In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week. 

For a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks. At 1.9%, Garcia Carreno said it's not close to the numbers of flu, COVID and RSV.

4176,seasonal infection\*
4177,"People are getting overly anxious about a seasonal outbreak, which isn’t surprising here in the Philippines given how many uninformed individuals believe everything they read online."
4178,"Dito rin naman may outbreak, lahat nga tayo sinipon at ubo after ng Pasko hahaha"
4179,"OP, did you read the whole article?"
4180,"Sige, fearmongering pa"
4181,Seasonal lang.. nothing to be worried about
4182,There is nothing to be alarm- DOH
4183,"Hmmm.......if you check ABSCBN's article, there's no direct source **where** they got this HMPV stuff. Copied lang din from American articles.

""News of the current outbreak *followed an announcement* by China’s National Administration of Disease Control and Prevention that it was testing a new reporting protocol in response to pneumonia cases."" so general pneumonia cases lang

""Across the border, India’s Health Ministry has confirmed two cases of HMPV in the state of Karnataka""

Sa India may outbreak but it doesnt mean galing sa China, but articles seem to imply it. Eh ang layo ng ""northern parts of China"" sa India

I will never trust the Chinese government, but I'm also not trusting western powers who might be spreading some sort of lowkey propaganda."
4184,Winter season kasi now kaya ayan madami nagkakasakit
4185,OP baka gusto mo muna magresearch di porke nakakita ka ng outbreak e akala mo bago yan
4186,"Tama na ang fearmongering ha. Lalo na 'yung quasi-scientific page na solely made for weather updates, puro unreliable sources naman."
4187,"Fear mongering or not, nagmamask prin ako tlga sa mga crowded places at nakaugaliang mag alcohol kapag humahawal ng mga kung anu ano sa labas (escalator, elevator, groceries etc). May mga habits na nung pandemic na hindi ko na inalis."

As clear as what was mentioned, ""seasonal"" infection siya. Also, an outbreak is different from an epidemic and far more different than a pandemic. 

Kulang talaga sa comprehension ang ilan..."
4192,"I'm still wearing face masks and nagaalcohol pa rin ako pag may nahahawakan ako na mga anik anik in public. I have senior parents and since I go to work, mas exposed ako labas. I do this to protect them. Mahirap na, iba ang immune system ng mga matatanda. Stay safe everyone."
4193,It’s actually due to winter season. Till early March yang ganyan sa mga areas na below 10C.
4194,"right now it's winter season sa US, so nakalabas na ang mask mandate esp in the healthcare setting since Nov. 1 up til March 31. they have what they call the Trifecta of Respiratory illnesses which consists of the common Flu, COVID and RSV."

CDC has not even confirmed there is an outbreak. Actually parang pinapakalat nila yang sa China na hindi naman ganong kalala and regular flu lang dahil may norovirus sa US and tinatabunan nila ung news dun.

Kahit naman ngayon dito sa Pilipinas ay malamig ang panahon at marami ang tinatrangkaso. Let us all stay vigilant and be prepared. : D"
4241,"Yes but tbh due to covid, fear like this is understandable.

I personally scared not because I'm not informed. I'm a graduating student and pandemic was not kind to me.

I'm scared of losing another year, another family member and losing the chance to live a life.

So I'm sorry if some us are scared with things like this.

Some of us still haven't recovered from the past pandemic, emotionally, financially and physically."

4280,Sana all nasa Canada hahaha. Ano pong feeling libre ang healthcare 😭❤️
4281,Covid sipon lang yan
4282,Basta kapag nagka symptoms please disclose your travel history. Ayan ang kinamatay ng mga frontliners natin last 2020. Mga nagtravel abroad tapos nilihim 'yung travel history then carrier na sila ng virus nahawa pa nila mga doktor at nurse natin.
4283,"Free healthcare is not as great as they make it up to be. May family doctor and nurses shortages sa Canada ngayon, you could be waiting for 17hrs+ just to be seen by doctor in an ER. Medication isn’t free, lalo kung wala kang insurance. Ang maganda lang siguro eh yun nga pag na operahan ka, usually libre. (Yun lang matagal kang naghihintay for whatever operation that may be)"
4284,"Masaya naman po basta hindi grabe yung sakit nyo kasi ang oa ng waiting time para makapagbook sa mga specialist 😭 naghintay ako ng 3 months para makapagpabook tapos another month para macheck pero 10mins lang ako ni-check. Other than that, maganda kasi nanganak ako twice wala ako kahit ano binayadan, may private room tapos dami binigay na supplies ng baby. Pag ER free visit din tska check ups sa walk in clinics pero mahirap makahanap ng family doctor kasi usually full na sila."
4285,Free nga but the service is shit. You need to wait more than 10 hrs sa emergency tapos hangga’t kaya mo pa at buhay ka pa tylenol lang bibigay sayo hahaha. Kuya ko na nag pa appointment for ENT he needs to wait for 6 months. came here 2020 nakahanap lang ako ng fam doctor last year

4290,"Yeah, my dad had to wait for atleast a YEAR to get his eye surgery, only for them to cancel, and he got told that they couldn’t operate ON THE DAY OFF the surgery. If only I was with him that time, I would have asked his surgeons to provide specific reasons as to why they cancelled his surgery. But they reasons that they gave was very very vague. 

Dito you’d have to be aggressive on advocating for yourself, because their approach of trying to diagnose / assess illnesses is very conservative at kung hindi mo advocate sarili mo nga nga ka talaga."

4292,"As an infectious diseases physician in India, this is bull. HMPV has been already seen by many colleagues of mine across India, and this is certainly not new. What we do not know is

1. How common is it this year? We do not routinely test, and since COVID, testing is more common. So, bias is likely.

2. Is it more severe? Not enough data to say so.

3. Is this the same variant as in china? Cannot say. We do not have genomic data on any of the isolates so far.

As of now, no reason to panic, but certainly a need to monitor."

HMPV is NOT a new virus. There are HMPV patients in India every year. There is a new strain in China apparently which is causing Havoc. But china being china, is not giving more information on this.

ECG report was negative but blood test showing some kind of infection in my body as per my doc so he started treatment without knowing what infection I'm dealing with. My condition started improving after 2 weeks of the treatment, I stopped treatment after 3 weeks but it hit back 1 week later, then I had to start taking medicines again, still on the medicine.

medicine for respiratory infection, congestion, fever and nasal drop

4347,Is HMPV seasonal in India at this time and are vaccines easily available?
4348,This should be the top comment
4349,"But if there is a sudden surge of cases then could this indicate that the virus has mutated to strain which is much more transmissible than other ones? Also, what if the virus mutates to a form which is as severe or more severe than COVID?"
4350,Thanks doctor!
4351,"From the article:

> This makes it the first case in India amid a surge in such cases in China. According to News18, the child does not have any travel history. The case was confirmed by the Karnataka Health Department. The case was reportedly conveyed to the Union Health Ministry.  According to News 18,It was not clear whether this was the same strain of HMPV causing a spike in China.

Read the last statement. 

> it was not clear whether this was the same strain of HMPV causing a spike in China.

There are many variants of HMPV, it's a group of Paramyxoviridae family of viruses, these viruses peak during the winter season, it's been there everywhere in the world since thousands of years. 

We can't say anything unless it is confirmed that it is the same variant of HMPV from China which is rapidly spreading there, there are other variants everywhere in the world that are least harmful (and even we don't know as of now that HMPV variant in China is harmful or not). 

I guess it's least likely to be HMPV China variant because the family doesn't have any travel history and neither they were in contact with anyone who had a international travel history according to the news.

Just be cautious however, wear a mask in crowded places but dont panic, irrespective of whether it's the Chinese variant or not, a viral flu is still dangerous for kids and the old."

Adding my 2 points, firstly other variants of HMPV has been around since 2001 and secondly even though, it was rare even then, there were still cases reported which affects children under 5.

So let's calm down and wait for the confirmation from ICMR and other relevant authorities, than spreading panic around."

Upon checking with doctor, he suggested to take CT. CT result showed pneumonia in right lung. Immediately, I admitted into hospital.

Just maintain distance from people especially those who are visibly sick and keep washing your hands from time to time. "
4408,"This is a virus that spreads by air, unless the contamination happened hours before goods is highly unlikely to transmit stuff. Please don't spread fear under the pretense of care."
4409,"That’s incredibly unlikely, bacteria and viruses don’t survive very long on non-organic surfaces. I think the longest for viruses is 3 days, some bacteria slightly longer as they have the ability to go dormant (but even then it’s not very long)… Viruses are just pieces of scrap RNA code floating around in the environment, they’re extremely delicate. Even being exposed to the air is extremely destructive to them, let alone sunlight / heat etc. 

If you sanitise everything you run the risk of developing autoimmune diseases because your bodies own immune system doesn’t have anything to fight and so starts attacking your own cells, like lupus / asthma / lymphoma etc."
4410,"No, your problem is weak immunity. 

Eat better, exercise and spend some time socialising and more enjoying life. 

Everyone is infected at all points of time, it’s only a lack of balance in your body immunity that makes some infections more visible.

Also, the cases found in India do not have a Chinese origin. The strain in India is probably completely different from that in China. There is a lesser chance of this virus converting into a full blown pandemic...unless there aren't any severe mutations."

>However, health officials have emphasized that HMPV is not a new virus but a relatively under-recognized respiratory pathogen.

Another excerpt:

>Some scientists have speculated that these mutations could make the virus more neurotrophic, meaning it may have a higher likelihood of affecting the nervous system.

One more:
 >A Familiar but Often Overlooked Threat HMPV is not a new pathogen. Discovered in 2001, it has been circulating globally for over six decades, causing infections across all age groups. According to Zheng Lishu, a virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus typically causes mild symptoms that resolve within a week. However, i t can lead to severe complications in vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

4719,"One post about a major illness in China is gaining traction on this sub, and some are debating whether it is avian flu. I did some research and it appears that the virus that is spreading is HMPV, which can cause ""acute respiratory tract infections in all ages, with similar symptoms to flu, including fever, cough, nasal congestion, and difficulty in breathing. The infection can progress to bronchiolitis or pneumonia."" Currently there is no licensed vaccine for HMPV infection."
4720,"Don't be fooled twice. In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak China insisted over and over again that there was nothing to worry about. They lied and said there was ""no clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission. They actively silenced and punished Doctors who tried to warn people (Dr. Li Wenliang). They waited until the last possible moment to admit there was an emergency. 

I'm not saying we should panic, this could absolutely be nothing. I'm just saying, don't take their word for it."
4721,HMPV is also known as a common cold virus. Hope that it isn’t all new and mutated though…

4727,Pretty sure I’ve already got this
4728,Worked in pathology and tested people for HMPV for years before Covid. HMPV is not new and was discovered 24 years ago - it is endemic globally. Everyone reading this has already has several colds in their life that were caused by an infection with this virus. So yeah there is zero reason to panic over this.

There are also no doctors making posts about a novel disease, at most I have seen some random people in China commenting that hospitals are full due to various reasons."
4738,The only difference is HMPV is not new and causes cold and flu-like symptoms. It’s not even the same kind of virus as COVID. It’s more like RSV.

4754,"You what’s interesting to me is that for as much as I agree with your not “freaking out over social media posts” that there will almost certainly come a time when something is being reported on but we ignore it. And this will
Be because of that issue of the constant mis-information , lies, deception, ai, etc. we are clearly being conditioned. This conditioning is unavoidable too. It’s just become part of the machine of life. You almost have to laugh at it ….there is a sadness to it but at the same time  ironic. Lies spread faster than any disease , not just verbally anymore but visually ."
4755,"> Monkeypox

Mpox was dealt with where I am by significant uptake of the vaccine by the gays, where it was initially spreading most.

The alarm was raised quickly and the medical community and health orgs acted quickly and significantly reduced it’s spread. There is still a major push to have more vaccination in the most at risk groups. 

Just because you’ve sat on the sidelines, doesn’t mean other people are. Things “didn’t happen” because people acted."
4756,"The good thing with Monkeypox was that it wasn't an airborn disease. It was highly severe and lethal, but not that infective, which is why it didn't cause an outbreak. Same as why Nipah didn't. Also the reason why Dengue and Malaria are not ravaging the world. Same reason why AIDS isn't so dangerous

Infectivity is king. The flus like Corona, Common Cold, Avian Flu etc are highly infective, and that is why they are widespread. Now, a lot of us have immunity to the cold, Avian flu and now Corona. Even those that don't have immunity are not that badly affected. The reason these are dangerous though is the fact that they overwhelm the hospitals and care sytems of every country. Imagine if a majority of every country went in the hospital at the same time. 

This is why lockdowns are so GOD tier good. They might seem as if they don't work, but that is because people have a wrong idea of what they are SUPPOSED to do. They are not supposed to stop every single person from getting infected, nor are they supposed to halt the spread. 

They SLOW the spread down, so that the hospitals don't get overwhelmed."
4757,"That’s all fine but would you accept the risk of getting run over by a car every time you cross the road being 33% as a tolerable risk? Cause that’s what your saying.

Not panicking is a great idea but it isn’t like every week we encounter 2 dozen possible novel pandemics.

It’s a few, every few years. 

From a risk management point of view the (marginal) cost is low and the upside inmense."
4758,"The doctor in question posted about a month after hospitals were overrun in China, keep that in mind."
4759,India is equally populated as China or maybe more..still we don't see it initiating such massive outbreaks

4762,"Symptoms that landed me in ER were shortness of breath, fever and coughing. Felt like bad flu. Even speaking was difficult due to SOB. Hospitalist later said he wondered what was making me so ill (there was mention of possible intubation) so he ran a specific test for HMPV. Hadn’t seen much of it here if any, and I’d never heard of it. There was one night I could not stop coughing and had trouble catching my breath. That was scary. After that night and once they knew what I had, I started doing better rapidly. Had to undergo cardioversion (2 shocks) to regain NSR. No issues since then. Thankful for my healthcare team. They literally saved my life.

Edit to add text:  COVID and flu tests were negative. Pneumonia was positive also. HMPV and pneumonia triggered aFib. aFib resolved after cardioversion but I am on blood thinner to prevent blood clots/stroke."
4763,"The thing is that “it’s not dangerous for healthy individuals”, but it can be severe on infants, elderly, people with respiratory problems (like asthma or EPOC), and immunocompromised, in that, something most news outlets miss is that COVID left a high percentage of the population immunocompromised (or with an immune dysfunction) and most don’t even know it (they just have a worst “health” than before), so, a few years ago, something like 1-2% of the population was in danger for a severe case of any virus, but now, that percentage has increased a lot (research is still being done, we don’t know if the immune dysfunction is temporary or what, but there is damage in the long term, for sure)"
4764,There is not one mention of the ongoing outbreak in the article talking about viral outbreaks.

There is not one mention of the ongoing outbreak in the article talking about viral outbreaks."
4766,If I didn’t have a whole pharmacy at home I would probably be in the hospital tbh
4767,"It won’t. Serological evidence shows it’s been circulating in humans for atleast 60 years without causing a pandemic, so there is very high existing population immunity, and it is not very virulent even in the unexposed anyway (everyone you know had it as an infant or toddler). It is not nearly as transmissible and doesn’t mutate as rapidly like coronaviruses. And it’s not like flu where human and animal strains can recombine every few years to cause pandemic strains. There’s no reason to worry about this becoming a pandemic any more than the HCoVs - or RSV, which has been similarly so overhyped in recent years that I’m basically waiting for the inevitable media pivot to PIV (parainfluenza) panic at this point!

If you want a vaccine for it, Moderna is working on a modRNA one since 2019 but I’m not sure what the hold up is though."
4768,…”it’s endemic”
4769,Yep. This is exactly why I’m sitting right on the border of “watching rationally on the sidelines” and “2025 is gonna be the fucking end”. I’ve lost count of the diseases that seem to be starting to gain traction at the same time bird flu is getting dangerously close as well and it terrifies me. I’m trying not to be a panic person but COVID was “low risk to the general public” until it wasn’t. This? I don’t even wanna entertain the thought.

 At least China is declaring."
4773,covid 19 came from a lab.  there is no evidence it came from a wet market and no animal has ever been found in nature with.  
4774,Oof. That sounds alot.. So there is a specific test needed to detect HMPV. Good thing they did that test and I'm glad you recovered from it.

4780,"during the time of Covid, dead bodies were falling...people were dying, remember? Not testing doesn't stop the disease...it doesn't stop the death, friend."
4781,Stop spreading misinformation. India might not have healthcare facilities like US but it has one of the best healthcare institutions. Heck India was one of the few countries who developed COVID vaccines and imported to other countries including the EUROPE. Infact India made 2 vaccines not even one. There will be testing done if they found a new virus spreading it’s not easy to take a blind stance when people die En masse.
4782,"Bruh why the fuck would they make such a weakass virus? If they want to get an actually good bioweapon, they should either use Prions and find a way to make them fast acting, or use Rabies.

4786,yea but not testing = can't confirm that COVID was the cause of said deaths and bodies.
4787,Serious all these conspiracy theorists if they really developed a virus they would make an even potent one and develop a vaccine for themselves first. lol so many people in china died compared to western world why would they develop a virus to kill themselves.
4788,"But we aren't discussing can't confirm aspect here
We are discussing we haven't seen any major pandemic starting from India since hundreds of years atleast..though India has comparable population to China

Whenever a pandemic starts from a country then people starts dying due to that ..no of deaths per day spikes suddenly which can be confirmed easily ..and we haven't seen starting in India .. that's what I said"

4790,"Relax, everyone.  If you’re old enough to be on Reddit, you’ve already had HMPV.  HMPV is thought to have spilled over from an unknown bird species between 200 and 400 years ago.  It is the third most common cause of viral pneumonia in children (7.5% of cases) behind rhinovirus (7.6%) and RSV (31-32%).  

This isn’t a novel virus.  It’s a seasonal virus, and if this year’s spike is slightly higher than in years past, it’s still not at a level that suggests anything like SARS-CoV-2."

4860,Hugh? You got sand in your vgna?
4861,"Yes not a novel virus, though considering the impact that COVID has collectively had on the immune systems of the population, I think some concern is warranted since non-novel viruses and infections (ie RSV and pneumonia) have increased in the years since COVID. 

Ultimately COVID has been a Pandora’s box and we don’t have the luxury of not worrying about old viruses anymore."
4862,"I think it was a typo. It is incredibly unlikely that a virus like Coronavirus managed to stay inside a single city for a whole year.

The problem is either it's human transmissible or it's not. If it's not, having it all happen in a geographically small area is quite unlikely. If it is, it would have spread outside of the city much quicker."
4863,The majority are rhinovirus (~60%) and yet HMPV is common enough that just about everyone has been infected by age 10.
4864,Leave room for a peddling machine as well to burn a few calories
4865,We've got just the thing to help with that!
4866,"I don't think it is safe to say that non-COVID viruses have increased as compared to pre-COVID.  There isn't a good way to answer that question because the way we do so has changed.  And even if it has, I don't think we are back at an equilibrium just yet."

4971,"I lost my Ma in spring of 2019 to hMPV. There were several patients in the hospital that had it and there were not enough ventilators to go around. Some patients had to make do with bi pap until a ventilator became available and some patients didn’t get chosen at all. The patients that qualified for ECMO treatment faired well but it is a steep hill of qualifiers that many folks find it out of reach. 

This particular virus has a very high incidence of causing cytokine storm which is what ultimately caused my mom’s demise. Her immune system went in to extreme overdrive and her organs shut down while her body threw blood clots causing heart attacks and strokes. 

For those of us that have seen it, it’s not click bait it has been a part of our every day lives. Panic won’t help, but covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands does go a far distance. Most people don’t…and they are unwilling to see that they can impact someone else’s life."

4988,We all forgot the covid days and lockdowns or what? Because yall forgot everything else about that time and the arguments. Use the R word on a joke and people have to defend something that never needed defending. Might be a tell after thinking about it.

4995,"Sorry, but that's just not true. A quick research reveals that HMPV and RSV are seasonal diseases in many countries and, just like the flu, only in certain groups with pre-existing diseases (cancer or lung disease) bring a high risk.

For a normal healthy person, it's like a cold, in worse cases, pneumonia."
4996,"Sorry, I was wrong. I confused it with HPV.

But HMPV is not that deadly and dangerous. Treatment is only symptomatic."
4997,"What part of that is bottish? You know that a conspiracy is a real thing that can happen, right? It's not just something to call someone a lunatic"
4998,"I don't know who that is. What do you think my ""previous instructions"" were?"
4999,"To me the most dangerous aspect of hMPV is how quickly it can overwhelm a medical system. The virus is just like any other we live amongst every day, however there are some mutations that have a tendency to require enhanced medical support even with healthy and young individuals. 

Post covid a lot of medical systems are struggling to regain their footing and balance. When we add to that people that are unable and/or unwilling to use mitigative practices it is easy to see how any virus can do real damage to communities quickly."

Já si říkal to samé že bude i s Covidem, neměl jsem pravdu.

Ale statisticky, takovýchto různých ohnisek šíření něčeho nebezpečného bylo hodně a v naprosté většině případů to zůstalo lokální, otázka jednoho státu či nakolika málo států.

Nevím co bude s tímhle, ale mám pocit, že média teď jsou extrémně silně zaměřené na každé drobné zakašlání, před rokem 2019 by to byla obskurní zpráva ze zahraničí, která nikoho nezajímá.

*( a samozřejmě ten bizár v titulku: není na ni vakcína. Evidentně není proto že ji nikdo neudělal. Bude to problém, bude se dělat na vakcíně, bude to blbost co za chvíli zmizí pomocí karantény? Vakcína nebude, protože nebude potřeba )*"

Místo aby byl připravený plán co se jen spustí a všichni vědí co dělat, tak se celý stát choval půl roku jak slepice bez hlavy, nebyly ochranné pomůcky atd.

A nezdá se mi, že by to příště mohlo být lepší. Obzvláště když třetinu populace tvoří kreténi co si myslí že se vlastně nic nedělo."

 Nejenom to, že tam jeli maximální cenzuru ohledně celkového dění poledne potenciálně nebezpečného viru, ale oni dokonce zavedli opatření proti šíření způsobem, že to nejvíce postihovalo ostatní země. Vnitrostátní lety a cestování bylo pozastavené, ale zároveň vůbec neudělali nic s lety mimo zemi. Někteří ťongové museli cestovat skrze zahraničí, aby se mohli dostat domů.

Přišel ředitel firmy a začal mít nějakej proslov o tom, omezení a takové ty věci, aby se ta firma prostě nerozsypala a především říkal, že v případě dodržení karantény si na to budou muset prostě vybrat vlastní dovolenou. Bylo to právě v době, kdy se ve velkém jezdilo do Alp lyžovat. On samozřejmě navrhoval, že by bylo nejlepší takovou dovolenou zrušit (tady kokoti ve střediskách v Alpách také prohlásili, že prostě nebudou vracet peníze).

Jedna ženská tam prostě řekla, že ""ona si to zaplatila a prostě pojede, že si tu dovolenou na tu karanténu raději vybere"". Vynásob to stovkou nebo více takových kreténů a už jsme najednou všichni doma kvůli nim."

5166,">Virusul metapneumovirus uman (HMPV) nu reprezintă o noutate, întrucât a fost identificat pentru prima oară în 2001, iar în România, în fiecare an, se înregistrează zeci de mii de cazuri de răceli cauzate de acest virus, a declarat joi ministrul Sănătății, Alexandru Rafila, pentru Agerpres.

>#Rafila: De câteva zile, sunt vehiculate foarte multe informaţii că ar fi venit în România un virus din China care produce infecţii foarte grave. Nu e cazul, discutăm despre o viroză banală / Metapneumovirusul produce infecţii obişnuite"
5167,"Nivel de incompetență nu încetează să mă uimească, atât de la presă cât și de la autoritățile locale. HMPV este endemic în toată lumea. Las mai jos conținutul unei postări făcute de Dr. Mihai Craiu.

___
Acesta nu este un tablou al unui pictor modern! Deși ar putea semăna cu anemonele lui Luchian, sau mai bine cu cele ale lui Gustav Klimt, acestea nu sunt niște flori.

Așa arată la microscopul electronic hMPV (faimosul metapneumovirus uman) care a generat emoții și discuții aprinse în ultimele zile. Da, în multe țari asiatice s-a observat o creștere a numărului de cazuri de infectare cu hMPV la copiii cu vârstă sub 14 ani și la seniori sau la cei cu imunodeficiență. - link în comentarii

Dar cam atât! Să ne uităm întâi la ce este cunoscut, înainte de a genera alte mesaje foarte alarmiste🤗

Pentru majoritatea pediatrilor nu a fost nicio surpriză! Virusul a fost descris în 2001 de către dr Bernadette van den Hoogen la copii răciți din Olanda, deși el exista de multă vreme. Se estimează ca el s-a desprins dintr-o familie de virusuri similare ce infectează păsările. Acum aproximativ 400 de ani.

Nu am știut să îl detectăm până acum dar el există de foarte multă vreme.

Eu am un slide dedicat hMPV, în cursul despre bronșiolita acută pe care îl țin la studenți, de peste 15 ani.

În 2012 am publicat, alături de colegii de la Spitalul Grigore Alexandrescu și de colectivul de experți ai Centrului Național de Referință în Boli Respiratorii de la Institutul Cantacuzino (condus la acea vreme de către dna dr Cristina Țecu) rezultatele unei cercetări ce își dorea să evalueze ce virusuri produc boli respiratorii  cu spitalizare (cum ar fi bronșiolita acută sau pneumonia) la copii.

Cel mai frecvent identificați, la acel moment, au fost VSR (virusul sincițial respirator), hMPV și adenovirus. Link in comentarii

Deci nimic nou sub soare🤗

De unde emoția? Pentru că vorbim despre un virus obișnuit, din familia Paramyxoviridae, rudă cu virusul rujeolos, de exemplu.

Probabil ne-am speriat din cauza faptului că ACUM stim că există acest ""dușman"", pentru că putem testa PCR-multiplex, în timp real, un număr extrem mare de persoane. Este moștenirea pandemiei...

Aceste teste PCR-multiplex pot identifica rapid peste 20 de virusuri și bacterii din secrețiile nazale ale unui bolnav.

Deci acum AM AFLAT cu toții că există hMPV, deși el era pe podium, alaturi de VSR și rhinovirusuri drept cauză a bolilor respiratorii. Este atât de frecvent încât 90% din copiii care merg la grădiniță vor face până la 5 ani o infecție cu hMPV. Și pentru că imunitatea pentru acest virus ""nu ține"", boala se poate repeta oricând.

La fel ca și la gripă, au fost descrise 4 tipuri de hMPV, în funcție de proteinele de suprafață F (de fuziune) și G (de atașament) care sunt  notate cu A1, A2, B1 și B2.

Este o simplă răceală pentru persoanele adulte sănatoase sau pentru copiii mai mari. Poate ceva mai zgomotoasă în 2025 decât în alți ani, dar cam atât.

Soluția?? Avem răbdare, luăm antitermice și ne hidratăm bine. Dacă e rău în continuare după 2-3 zile mergem la medic.

Și nu dăm și altora boala!!! Adică respectăm eticheta tusei, ne izolăm câteva zile și spălăm bine mâinile.

Multă sănătate!

5217,"Da și nu. Depinde ce înțelegi prin ""formă evoluată"" și ""virus cunoscut"".

SARS-CoV-1 și 2 fac parte din genul Betacoronavirus (alături de MERS-CoV) dar sunt unice în subgenul Sarbecovirus. Adică până în 2020, SARS-CoV-1 era singurul Sarbecovir. Ambele SARS-CoV au un strămoș comun, având o similaritate genetică reciprocă de ~80%. Practic asta l-a făcut ""novel human coronavirus"", diferența genetică față de cele cunoscute și faptul că nu a mai fost detectat în oameni până atunci.

HMPV face parte din genul Metapneumovirus, dar nu este mai departe segmentat în subgenuri, ci în linii genetice (A/B). Toate cazurile de HMPV genotipate până acum nu au indicat existența unei noi linii genetice, deci nu este ""novel"".

Ca idee, în cazul gripei, literele A,B,C reprezintă de fapt clasificarea de genus (Alphainfluenzavirus, Betainfluenzavirus etc), mai departe ele sunt grupate în subtipuri/linii genetice (H1, N1, Yamagata etc)."

5261,Covid 19 was not a known virus. There were Corona virus’s already but corona describes the shap of the virus itself they weren’t the same thing
5262,Australia has actually been dealing with it since 2017 and get the occasional case. But yeah.. let’s blow it out of proportion and get everyone scared
5263,So Gujrat and Bangalore. That's two.
5264,"\*\*Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)\*\* is a common respiratory virus that causes infections similar to the flu, such as cough, fever, runny nose, and sore throat.

Currently, there has been a \*\*rise in HMPV cases in China\*\*, which has raised global health concerns

However, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has detected only a few cases in India, and there is no unusual surge in infections. 2-3 cases in India.

Health authorities are closely monitoring the situation and have issued guidelines to manage the spread.

As for another pandemic, there is no indication of a new pandemic at this time."
5265,"Not worried at all.

5268," No, confirmed in Bangalore first."
5269,Damn the virus struck the best state in the country
5270,"What are the symptoms? I kinda got really ill after a Delhi flight. Paracetamol n usual antibiotics didn't work, no dengue  but similar symptoms, coughing, runny nose etc

Had to be hospitalized for 4 days with a lot of nebulizer n iv fluids n paracetamol. Doc said the RT PCR would cost 20k but wouldn't affect the symptom treatment so I didn't go for it."
5271,Be careful with this as your usual antibiotics don’t work. It’s also been detected in the US- southern region. People with underlying respiratory problems take note. Let your family and friends know right away.
5272,"This ain’t too bad. I had it last week. 

It basic flu like symptoms and that’s it. A few days of cough, cold, and fever - the symptoms were much milder than Covid."
5273,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world."

Thats why some European counties didn’t report first case till long after many cases had become live. But Italy did drastic testing and saw most of the cases in Europe"
5283,Take care
5284,"Quite informative, as of now, there are 10 plus cases..
Out of the total 11 cases reported so far, two were reported in Bengaluru, one in Gujarat, two in Chennai, three in Kolkata, two in Nagpur, and one in Mumbai.

https://www.foxnews.com/health/bird-flu-uptick-us-has-cdc-alert-pandemic-red-flags-report

A giant biased headline for clicks like all other media does. It's not just the media on the left. It is all media.

This isn't true we have had quite a few in-between that, like the 09 swine flu and a few other flu pandemics. 


 - Yet every sniffle anywhere in the world results in calls for the next pandemic, masking and lockdowns. Monkey pox, norovirus, RSV, HMPV, bird flu - every one is an existential crisis according to the media fear machine.

5296,"They constantly snarked about how we ""needed another plague to cull the herd."" Then we got a plague and they turned into hysterical hypochondriacs who publicly screeched at women and children if they thought they were being put in danger.

Just accept the fact that conservatism has failed in America because they chose to embrace racism in a post-Holocaust world that won't tolerate it.  There's nothing to hate about the left.  In fact, the more people like you join - the more you'll be able to pressure the left on your pain points, whatever they are."
5303,"Idk if this post is part of the propaganda or if op has fallen for propaganda. But another pandemic is coming. It's not avoidable and Americans are too I don't know self-indulgent to fight it. So I can see the conservative narrative that's trying to make the coming pandemics a leftist versus right thing So again that's what it hurt Trump's last presidency.

For contaxt covid is coming back in a major way. Although I didn't really go away people just pretend that it did. You have a deadly bird flu hitting United States. In China has just gotten a weird new virus that's killing people. So a pandemic is coming. So I imagine we're going to get a lot of these posts"

Deadly disease? Yes. Problem? Yes. Difficult? Yes. Horrible *flu*? Yes. Bad for many people? Yes. Tragic? Yes.

But covid wasn't anything like the black death or most of the pandemic level problems faced in history. Ebola is just one example of the many ""lids"" we currently keep down.

I'm not trying to downplay covid exactly, just that in the disease world it's a ""starter"", a ""beginner threat"". The monsters in the ""closet"" are worse and scarier than covid could ever be. Covid is scary to people who are sheltered and don't understand the depth of the shit and horror the world has. Honestly covids origin is the scarest part of it, far more than the disease itself.

5321,"Apparently, OP doesn't know about medical history. FOUR flu pandemics have happened in the last 100 years(1918, 1957, 1968,2009). Other pandemics by NIH criteria were cholera in 1961, SARS IN 2002, Ebola, and AIDS. Pandemics are considered widespread previously unknown diseases or diseases known that have become widespread and uncontrollable. Pandemics and regional epidemics have been the NORM throughout history. We all just haven't been exposed to much of it because of modern sanitation and strong health departments. All that is now going by the wayside. Buckle up kids, the ride is going to get real bumpy from here on out. My state stripped the health department of powers it had to keep disease in check for over one hundred years because ""muh freedum."""

5328,"The ""last pandemic"" you are referring to is  the Spainish of 1918. It wasn't 100 years until the next pandemic. It was 49 years with the 1957   [Asian flu ](https://www.clinicallab.com/a-timeline-of-pandemics-22047). It wasn't 51 years until the next pandemic. It was 11 years with the Hong Kong flu. Then 13 years until 1981 and HIV. 19 years until SATS. 7 years until Swine flu of 2009. Then, like Rudolph, the most famous one of all, 2019's Covid. Actually, despite your claims, they seem to be more frequent now.    


Every little sniffle is reported so that a potential candidate for the next pandemic is spotted early. This is the primary function of CDC labs around the world. To monitor sniffles for the next epidemic. Covid was originally listed as an unknown flu variant. The sudden surge in sniffles gave it away much earlier than if we had waited for you to acknowledge it as a pandemic."
5329,"I believe it was Bill Mahr who said (paraphrasing because I can't be arsed to lookup the precise quote)

>One of the ways we get Trump out of the white house is a bad economy, so bring on the recession.

This was shortly before the Covid response induced recession."
5330,"This entire post is filled with half-truths and presumptions but I'll try to address the most obvious ones.

> Pandemics are rare

With the advent of mass industrial animal agriculture as well as the rise of wet markets in Asia, the risk of major pandemics rises. A lot. This is something which has been understood since the 1970s, that the potential for viruses to mutate with a much wider variety of animals increases due to modern agricultural methods. 

SARS, in 2002-2003, was contained before it spread too much. We were *extraordinarily* lucky to contain it, and it took a combined effort of dozens of countries mobilizing lockdowns and restrictions to take it down. If it had spread to pandemic levels, and it was a *high chance* it would have if we didn't catch it early, it had a death rate of 8-12%. Aka hundreds of millions dead. SARS uniquely spread due to wet markets. It is a pandemic which never would have happened without those modern factors mentioned above. Same with Covid. 

>  every one is an existential crisis according to the media fear machine.

RSV and Norovirus were never viewed as 'pandemics'. Norovirus can come in waves and be awful to go through (my family just had it... awful), but nobody views it as a crisis. Its still news worthy when cases spike in your city, but you are being dishonest trying to say its viewed as an existential crisis. 

The real issue is Bird Flu. That is a genuinely *massive* concern and should not be downplayed. There is not an epidemiologist in the world right now which is not extremely concerned about bird flu mutating for human transmissibility. It has spread to animal populations worldwide at a rate we have never seen in the past year, and is rapidly approaching the ability to cause human to human transmission. Bird flu has a mortality rate of 40%. This is not something to scoff at.  

Even assuming bird flu doesn't materialize into anything? As I said before, because of modern agricultural, we are still going to be dealing with the threat of pandemics much, much more commonly than in the pre-modern era."
5331,"I can safely say that I do not want another pandemic. The problem with the right is that they never listen to us when we are telling you what needs to be done to prevent these pandemics.

In this case, we need herd culling to prevent it. But you don’t listen and then when there’s a massive outbreak you won’t want to do anything to prevent loss of life either. 

God the right is stupid"
5332, We would the left want another pandemic when trump didn’t want to help Americans in the first place and said it wasn’t real
5333,"Lol ok man i agree this is a truly unpopular opinion, but that's because it's truly half-baked nonsense."
5334,Tell me you don’t know what a pandemic is without telling me you don’t know what a pandemic is…
5335,"I’ve honestly mostly seen freak outs from the right, about how “they” are planning to dupe us all with the next lockdown and violate us in a multitude of ways with an outbreak of {insert virus here}. 

Other than the avian flu, (RSV is pretty fucking bad for kids especially though) which could potentially be a big fucking deal if it mutates, it’s mostly just the media reporting on outbreaks of common winter viruses so people can you know, wash their hands more often or take a bunch of Vitamin C or avoid little kids like the plague, take whatever their preferred prevention method is, like they have reported on for decades lol. 

I swear if the right wasn’t shitting their pants about some regular, run of the mill thing every two seconds I’d think the world had ended. 

It’s also peak entitled, self centered American to say that some of those things are no cause for concern for anyone “with a functioning immune system”. A lot of those viruses fuck people up and even kill a large number of people every single year, we just don’t hear about it as much as newer developments. 

Also guessing that you don’t have kids, because if you’ve ever had a kid who caught the Norovirus and has it rocketing out of both ends for 48 hours, you’d be watching for any sign of that shit coming around again, trust me."
5336,"I think this is overblown paranoia. No one “wants” a pandemic; they’re catastrophic events. The media reports on public health risks to raise awareness and save lives. Viruses like RSV or bird flu aren’t framed as existential crises but as reminders to stay informed. Vaccines and basic precautions are about protecting vulnerable populations, not fear-mongering. A functioning immune system isn’t bulletproof, and public health measures are about collective responsibility—not some media conspiracy."
5337,"You are describing the news cycle. That's not THE LEFT discussing trends, risks and measures to be taken. That's doctors, thats their job. Some are taking their research and notices and trying to sell newspapers with it."
5338,"as someone who considers himself pretty leftist, i am NOT hoping for another pandemic."
5339,"If we did have another, particularly in the first 12-18 months of Trump taking office, do you think Evangelicals wimould associate it as a curse from God for picking suck a morally bankrupt character?
Yeah, me neither.
That's why they are hard to take seriously, because if it were a (D) in office, they'd be screaming about it.
And that's why I can't take them seriously"
5340,The last pandemic was in 2020 and before that was swine flu in 2009 which caused at least schools to not operate

5342,"we're going to see more and more pandemics now as the world is both more globalized and the temperature rises, they are going to become more common anyway

there's a pretty big difference between a seasonal rhinovirus and a disease with 50% lethality like the bird flu that is spreading in animals right now

all right wingers really care about are the lockdowns, you just don't want to lose access to your treats again"
5343,Bull Shit.  The left doesn’t want another pandemic.
5344,The only people I see keeping the pandemic alive are people who think COVID was fake and that the vaccine is a bio weapon. No one fucking cares.

5346,Especially if they can pin it on the opposition
5347,Never let a good crisis go to waste.
5348,"Yeah the whole point of this post is that left wing people especially seem to want a second pandemic. When I read opinions from people who aren't left wing, none of them seem to want a second pandemic, or if it happens they do not want to repeat the things that were done by the left (lockdowns, mandates etc.)."
5349,Fruit booter! Haven't heard that since highschool.
5350,"Can’t trust any especially the wood pushers and fruit booters. Shifty, shady SOBs"
5351,"When they say 'public health risk' they mean the active risk *right now*, meaning its not actively widely spreading and people shouldnt need to be taking precautions. 

The fear with bird flu is that it will mutate for more transmissibility among humans eventually, which could trigger a pandemic. That is not just fearmongering. There is not an epidemiologist in the world right now which is not sounding alarms about the *massively* increased risk of a bird flu pandemic in the last 2 years."
5352,"Also sometimes they'll add a paywall which drives people away from reading the article even more, but the title is always visible no matter what"
5353,Take a look here on reddit - several subs dedicated to worshipping pandemics and even normal subs being dominated by pro pandemic weirdos.

5355,"> Can we cut the left vs. right bullshit and get together against corporations, please?

You're almost there. Something happened in 2008 that they don't ever want to reoccur, hence racial, gender and political tribalism. Anything to keep the unwashed masses from discussing the economic classes."
5356,The swine flu was a pandemic? I remember in 2009 my gf got that and I brought her food on my lunch break and she told me she had it. I was like “damn that’s crazy I hope you’re okay” then she invited me in to fuck and just told me not to kiss her so I wouldn’t get it. I was dumb enough at the time to not realize that’s not how things work. We fucked for like 45 minutes and I was late to work. I was perfectly fine.
5357,Swine flue was joy a pandemic by any stretch of the imagination. You do know what a pandemic is? Describe how 2008 fit that definition.

5365,Why are you so sure that a pandemic is coming near term? Sounds like you are the one who fell for the propaganda. Explain how we went a hundred years between pandemics.
5366,Not at all. Not everyone is a covidiot or a denier. There are rational people in the middle ground.
5367,Are you claiming that twice as many republicans died because they didnt wear masks?
5368,"No, you see, what *actually* happened was, Faucci *engineered* Covid to *target* conservatives somehow, and the dems who died were just collateral damage.

Yeah... That's the ticket."

Just got a new mutated COVID virus that is immune to the current vaccines was pushed back to covid day one. You have bird flu in the United States which is hurting or killing people. I remember how America got covid was because Donald Trump didn't want to lock down America.

Even a few weeks of the economy shutting down would probably be devastating and.... lead to a surge in the popularity of the extreme Right who wouldn't need to do anything other than promise  to ""reopen factories and let people go to bars unmasked again"" to win landslide after landslide..

That plus with  COVID having proven to be ""a minor issue"" ( it wasn't) that ""fizzled out on it's own"" (it didn't) it's extremely unlikely that people will comply with any measures to begin with."

Currently i am not high risk so i don’t get it. At some point, i will get old enough where it makes sense and then I will get it. Same for the flu vaccine. When covid was bad, i got vaccinated. Now, covid is just another strain of endemic cold virus so I don’t get it. For older people, people with comorbidities or immune compromised, it probably makes sense for them."

Why are you asking questions to Reddit a google search would answer for you?"

5452,"The 2002–2004 outbreak of SARS, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), infected over 8,000 people from 30 countries and territories, and resulted in at least 774 deaths worldwide.

It fits the definition of a pandemic, a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease over a whole country or the world at a particular time."
5453,Also AIDS. AIDS is/was a pandemic. So you started off just plain wrong.
5454,It was declared a pandemic years before COVID lmfao 🤣
5455,"No- they are corporatists. I don’t care where they fall on a left to right scale. That’s mostly for people like you who view politics like team sports.

5466,Yeah what pussies they are! Being considerate of those around them and not wanting to spread a potentially deadly illness! It's almost like they care about the vulnerable members of their community!
5467,"I mean sure, but even then, the subreddit isn't bad or anything. Bird Flu is a major potential crisis which deserves attention. The guy above is making it out as if people *want* the pandemic to happen, in reality everybody on the sub wants the opposite."

5474,How does this corelate to mask compliance and numbers of death?   Or fake stories about maga hats and mass graves?
5475,If you cant live without me getting vaccinated then oh well - sounds pretty bad when you pit it that way. If you cant function in society then not my problem.
5476,"Do you know why you’re not credible? People like you do it ALL the time. It’s a tell, like from poker."
5477,"Why is testing such an issue for you? Shouldn’t we encourage people to test themselves if possible? Wouldn’t that lead to a more informed public and decrease the likelihood of a small outbreak or unnecessarily infecting the elderly? Also most people i know who still test themselves, myself included, just have a bunch of leftover tests and figure they may aswell use them. 

Just seems silly to get worked out about this and insinuate that the left is wishing for another pandemic which killed millions and ruined the lives of everyone. NO ONE WANTS THAT TO HAPPEN. You’re just vilifying the whole left with silly rhetoric which doesn’t help anyone. 

The left could also say the right is hoping for violent migrant crime to occur, or really any crime occurring as long as the crime is being committed by someone who isn’t white. That way they can push how bad immigration is. So would you say the right is hoping for immigrants to commit crimes to push a message? See how silly it is to talk like this?"
5478,So you don’t think Covid is still around? I think you’re searching for people to prove your theory. Saying Covid around is just a fact. I’ve haven’t seen any one of real stature calling for lockdowns or hoping for another pandemic. I say of stature cause you can find one rando that says anything.
5479,How is testing a problem for you?
5480,Well shit that's a great idea.  Let's just cure cancer by not testing for it!

5485,"I mean I don’t have to pay for my healthcare or for my kids to get great educations in public school. They don’t have to do active shooter drills either, so overall they are working out pretty well. Thanks for asking."
5486,Cite the facts from your source :)
5487,Can you honestly say Lock downs didn't work in America when America didn't actually lock down. I mean America had some pretty populated protesters for over a year during covid and I doubt those bikers who had that year biker party wore masks.
5488,"Firstly, just because you don't like the data doesn't make it fake. life will be much easier for you in the end if you just learn to swallow your pride and change your views when the facts no longer support them.

Second, don't ask stupid questions you already know the answer to. you guys refused to wear masks and whines like children about it. you had more covid deaths. what else could *possibly* be going on there?"
5489,"I didn't mention vaccines, I can function in society fine."
5490,"Do what all the time? Talk about epidemiology? 

Before Covid, did you think SARS was fake? Did you think the bubonic plague was fake? Did you think the Spanish Flu was fake? HIV? 

Or is it just anything past 2020  that is suddenly automatically fake to you. Anything past that *must* be a conspiracy run by dr fauci, right? But anything before, totally real pandemic."
5491,It’s not a problem for me. It just shows that the cult of Covid just wont die.

Gaslight much?"
5498,"I can say that before the protests/riots even started there were lockdowns of all kinds of varieties in the US, and they didnt work at all in any situation.  We can call them something different than ""lockdowns"" if you wish, but the lockdowns that the left side (typically) wanted to do had no impact."
5499,"Define lockdown. What measures exactly are considered a lockdown according to your interruption and how long should it last? What metric and governing authority decides when, where and how long to lockdown? 

Remember ""two weeks to flatten the curve""? Many countries had some form of lockdown/mandates that lasted years. It's clear no amount of ""full lockdown"" (whatever that looks like) would have ended it quickly. They had no intention of ending it quickly. 

It was a massive social experiment and propaganda campaign."
5500,"You actually believe there were dumpsters full of maga hats and mass graves somehow associated with republicans?  This is tinfoil hat stuff dude...

If you have actual data showing masks saved half of deaths for democrats, lets see that data not some random google search."
5501,And yet you want to be locked down for 6 months - sounds perfectly functional.
5502,"Yeah, your response is the other thing people like you do that gives you away. 

Plus, the fact you can never simply respond to a direct question."
5503,"oooh, so close. Actually it just shows that *Covid* just won't die. There is, of course, no ""cult of Covid""."
5504,"No cure bit knowing what I'm sick from is rather helpful, you treat covid differently to the flu and differently to a stomach infection. So knowing let's me plan accordingly, also gives a rough time frame for how long I'll be sick."
5505,Exactly.  We stop testing for all diseases and cure them all!
5506,If you have any decency it keeps you from going out and spreading it
5507,Knowing you have covid let's you know what you need to do as far as treatment. Just like urgent care will test you for the flu and if it's positive will prescribed tamiflu. I thought i had covid a couple months ago. Tested negative and kept getting worse. Went to urgent care and had ended up with pneumonia. Bit of prednisone and some antibiotics had me running in a week.

5520,"I am arguing that lockdowns didnt work, and the important part of the argument is that the people mostly on the left claimed they did work and took away rights from individuals to enact a thing that didnt work.  So if Trump was saying we shouldnt do the lockdowns then he was correct and should be praised for that, and criticized for the other things he failed on."

It is a seasonal disease that usually occurs in the winter and early spring, similar to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and the flu."

5623,This strain is unknown tho
5624,No. in covid I remember almost everyone had a travel history in their family
5625,Universe
5626,I read in other subs. This is common outbreak. Last year also china have this hmpv outbreak. And it mostly affects babies because their immunity is low. Chances of this becoming big is less.
5627,"The virus itself is not new, it's common.

Just like how every corona virus is not Covid 19, not all of HMPV virus is the chinese variant of it."
5628,"2023 and 2024 me bhi, lekin kuch hua tha kya??"
5629,Oh it's just a common cold ?
5630,Initially it wasn't documented. HMPV cases have already exited and people have recovered from it. Same can't be said about covid.
5631,And the others are yet to be reported
5632,tumko kya tapleek hai
5633,Precautions time pe li kaha hai aaj tak - kehna asaan hai lekin lock down and even flights halt karne ke major economic repercussions hote hain. Obviously itne serious steps baad mein liye jayenge. WHO has also not made a statement on the issue yet.

5638,"Yeah. Its nothing but cold. Only older people, new borns and people with weak immune should be careful. These news channels are fear mongering to get views."
5639,"Bro Covid was coronavirus which was known since 2000s. It was documented. The new mutated strain fucked everyone up.

Same with HMPV. I'm so hell bent on this cause I got a viral fever rn as we speak with exact COVID like symptoms."

5645,Lol 😂
5646,another study material
5647,"Thanks man, it's been 4 days already :(

Still can't smell shit. Still coughing. What a life haha"
5648,"Drink fluids, ORS, soups, coffee etc. They may not help with the recovery, but sure would make you feel better."
5649,"Hey, the same thing happened to me. I'm sick from 3-4 days, same Covid symptoms. I do catch common cold in winters but it stays for max 2 days, but this time even after taking paracetamol I ain't recovering:("
5650,They still going on about 5G?
5651,These idiots will lick a bird to prove they're smarter than us.
5652,"They better hope we keep H5N1 under control then.  It's far more deadly than COVID was, and refusing to take precautions will almost certainly end in an early death."
5653,"I am willing to bet some serious money that if we did have a legitimate malburg virus outbreak that actually manages to spread, all of these idiots would be begging for some vaccine. If people thought covid was scary, the idea of Malburg spreading is on another level completely.

 We are lucky that hemorrhagic fever doesn't spread that easily."
5654,Back at it again with the 5G activation.
5655,I get a kick out of the “I heard” statements with no attribution. Reminds me of a famous conman with his “many people are saying” statements.
5656,"Who the f is “they”?  Trump is president on Monday.  If he locks down because people are dying, who do they blame?"
5657,At this rate by the time 5G activation happens we'll all be on like 8G or something.
5658,"What are the odds these people know what 5G actually is. I don't even know what 5G is if someone were to ask me. I'd be literal with the letter as a joke and be like the G stands for generation. It's the 5th generation of internet lol.

Or gnomes. They now have 5 gnomes working. 

Either way I have feeling a G isn't something that can be sent to the body."
5659,They're totally going to use 5G to trigger the kill switch implanted via the COVID vaccine.... Any day now... Trust me bro
5660,But why Marburg? I am always so irrationally annoyed that they think Marburg is even slightly likely as some sort of mass death cause. Flu is right there guys! The proven winner in this race! Or pneumonic plague if you want to get arcane. Marburg requires INHALING SICK HORSE SPUTUM!
5661,"Imagine being so stupid that you think there can only be one deadly virus circulating at a time...it's not a tag team match, it's a melee."
5662,"Do they know what Marburg is?  Because hemorrhagic fevers rank not very far below rabies on the list of diseases I never want to contract.  If something that like got to pandemic levels and I caught it and died because some idiot didn't believe in taking necessary precautions, I would haunt the fuck out of them, and I would not be a friendly ghost."
5663,The potential for a mass casualty event that doesn’t involve bullets gets bigger and bigger every day.
5664,I’ll tell you right now if Marburg starts floating around and they tell me I need a vaccine I’ll be first in line.

5674,There is a 0% chance RFK’s health department is going to keep H5N1 under control. The only thing that’s going to hold it back from going human to human is its own mutations. So basically we just need to hope it doesn’t mutate the wrong way.
5675,Hemorrhagic fevers *terrify* me. That they're just randomly tossing Marburg around in the comments like it's nbd is insane to me.

5681,"I don't think pneumonic plague is as arcane of a threat as many would think. Yersinia pestis already has antibiotic resistant strains. Fortunately it's not a widespread organism in nature and thus less likely to pick up new virulence factors through horizontal gene transfer. I'm far from an expert, but we work with Yersinia (among many other organisms) at my job and it's scary stuff."

What's that? Evolves literally a million times faster than humans do? Oh my..."
5687,"They heard it online somewhere  they have no idea what they are talking about. Covid was horrible for a lot, but a lot of measures put in place shielded a lot of people from the consequences.  Add to it that some folks only got a minor illness it was easy to dismis. Having people in the street being carried out of their homes by people in hazmat suits as they bleed from every opening is not easy to ignore."
5688,"They don’t know what it is. And even if they do, they’ll say it’s some “woke lie”. You could have a drug resistant version of the plague emerge and if there’s any chance of a vaccine being attached to it, they’ll just act like it’s no big deal.

If they want to fuck around and find out, they can. But they best not dare show their face at any emergency room begging for medical attention. Why treat them for something they don’t believe in?"

5695,I still don’t understand what china has to gain by saying there is an outbreak. I get concealing one.
5696,"I don't see anything on this at The International Center for emerging infectious disease website. Cases usually show up pretty quick there.  Their ticker has all cases of emerging infectious diseases.  Might be a good cross check site to verify information.

Here is the link.  
[https://promedmail.org/](https://promedmail.org/)"
5697,Thank you for letting us know regardless!
5698,That's not much different than the American numbers. What we are concerned with *most* is person to person spread of a highly pathogenic variant like D1.1.
5699,Hmmm...it does make you wonder though as it could be a real story sometime this year.
5700,"To be fair, the first time I heard about Covid was NTD reporting on it in 2019, well before China admitted there was a novel virus. Take it with a grain of salt, but I wouldn't immediately dismiss them for being part of an anti-china movement."
5701,Is there mortality?
5702,"Don’t look at the probable spread of H5N1 currently happening in America, Human Resources. Look at the East and Be Afraid"
5703,"It’s been a ticking time bomb all last year, this wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest. Especially considering how the Covid situation had to be leaked unofficially before we knew as well, granted it was an actual doctor that leaked it."
5704,I love how everyone in this sub can comment and speculate without everyone screaming “fear monger” at eachother. Never commenting on threads about infectious diseases on main page again.
5705,Fake News /s
5706,You can’t trust anything coming out of China.
5707,"Lines up with what I heard a few weeks ago, that was supposedly in Shangdong"
5708,"To be fair, this is not China saying there is an outbreak but New Tang Dynasty media, i.e., Epoch Times:

>The principal goal of Epoch Times – now publishing in 36 countries under the supervision of a network of non-profits – is not to generate profit, he says, but to mount a long and broad “influence operation”. And the goal of that influence operation, in turn, is “to foment anti-CCP sentiment”. [via the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/30/falun-gong-media-epoch-times-democrats-chinese-communists)

So make with that what you will. There's definitely much to gain by concealing, and I suspect if H5N1 goes human-to-human in China we probably won't hear about it until it is too late, as with COVID-19."
5709,Spitballing: chaos? A easy to make other h5n1 areas anxious and breed unrest? Money?
5710,"This is the other way around, just like last time"
5711,"Yeah, that's why the post is flaired as speculation.

5776,I read this and googled the virus and read about it a bit. Mostly seems like fear mongering. This was first isolated in 2001. Its a mild cold like virus that usually clears up on its own and is scary for mostly children and old folks. Sometimes it can cause serious symptoms but it's pretty much like a viral infection.

5790,Oh! Great! Now I shall know which virus I am looking at the next time I see a virus!!
5791,Nice
5792,Lmao almost all of these are just the stock biorender figures
5793,Agreed. It should have at least taken the different sizes into consideration
5794,Not all phages are T4 lol
5795,The retrovirus is the exact graphic for retrovirus you find on biorender. I think they probably just went on biorender and used all the pre-made graphics for each virus.
5796,Pretty far from accurate? How so for a diagram lol
5797,"The shapes are reasonably accurate, but not all of these are specific viruses. For example, HIV is a lentivirus. Several others are groups of viruses such as alphavirus, bunyavirus, and picornavirus."
5798,"That phage looks like  T4 or lambda phage. T7 looks kind of similar, but it's shorter. M13 phage looks very different. It’s more boring looking, but it’s the coolest one IMO because of its use in phage display. Qβ phage has a super cool looking icosahedral capsid. So basically, no, that structure is not really representative of all phage, but there are at least several that look like that."
5799,"A lot of these are visible with electron microscopes, I am not a virologist but have definitely been in immunology seminars and seen images of HIV on the outside of cells and they look roughly circular like this, I assume the others are similar but most will just look like circles and not distinguishable by eye.

Bacteriophage are likely the most common in terms of sheer number, but only infect bacteria so are mainly there to keep the gut bacteria in check I guess."
5800,"The pictured phage is dsDNA tailed phage of the myoviridae morphology. It is one of 3 common morphologies (the others being podoviridae and siphoviridae). 
It is the standard biorender template and reasonably accurate, but phages are grossly underrepresented here 😔 it should probably also say ""caudoviricetes"" instead of ""bacteriophage""."
5801,"Or AAV separate from parvovirus, or HIV separate from lentivirus. 


Like why specify AAV but leave adenovirus off the list entirely?


Because the person making the image knows squat about viruses and just randomly pulled premade viruses from biorender into one graphic."
5802,😂
5803,"but hey, if i’m ever sick ill know that if it’s a blue virus it’s SARS-CoV-2 and if it’s green then it’s SARS-CoV!"

5805,Exactly. Where are the Leviviridae?

* A leak from the Heritage Foundation to some journalists revealed that the neonazi ngo is planning to deanonymize Wikipedia contributors in the USA and feed their identity information (eg faces, addresses) to the network of social media lynch mob generators like Libsoftiktok for targeting. (I followed up on the WMF T&S team's internal messaging - T383236 on the WMF Phabricator if anybody cares - and the T&S team are insisting that this isn't a big deal, lmao)

* A lot of Richmond, Virginia has been screwed by a sudden water infrastructure collapse.

* Campaigning continues for the German elections in February and the prospect of non-AFD turnout collapsing is very scary, especially since the SPD, CDU and GRUNE are saying that the Dunkelflaute was a one-off and that everything is under control. Maybe it won't happen. Musk has been aggressively pro-AFD online and is probably doing illegal stuff in support of them already.

* Zuckerberg went on JRE to propagandize himself some more and implied that the Facebook/Instagram/Whatsapp ecosystem of tech products will soon be leveraged to better connect American police to the anti-American dissidents they want to find (although he calls them antifa). Scary."

5987,"The estimated loss  in the LA wildfires is at 125 Billion, cost to rebuild estimated at 500 Billion or $12,000 per person in California."
5988,"It’s early Monday morning, January 13, 2025, and Los Angeles feels quiet. 

The skies are clear, schools will reopen, and the general vibe is that the worst is behind us. Fires have burned nearly 40,000 acres, 24 people have died, and containment on the two largest blazes—the Palisades and Eaton Fires—sits at 13% and 27%, respectively...those are unsettlingly low numbers, and with Santa Ana winds building tonight and peaking Tuesday, the risks ahead feel undeniable.

I've been discussing this with a few friends I have in LA, they've said we don't have to worry as Sunday was definitely a better day. Although, here’s what the conditions suggest could happen over the next 48 hours:

1. Winds will escalate the fires. Winds don’t arrive all at once—they build. Starting tonight, gusts will climb to 30–60 mph, drying out vegetation and carrying embers 1–2 miles ahead of the fireline. By Tuesday morning, spot fires could ignite in urban neighborhoods like Brentwood, Santa Monica, and Venice. Fragile containment lines will likely fail, and the fires will spread into areas that feel “safe” right now.
2. Air quality will plummet. Smoke and ash will blanket much of LA by Monday afternoon, with air quality reaching hazardous levels (AQI 300–400). Outdoor activity will become dangerous even far from the flames, and ash will cover streets and cars across the city.
3. Evacuations and gridlock will follow. Expanded evacuation orders in urban zones will overwhelm the 405, 10 Freeway, and Sunset Blvd. Schools reopening Monday morning may close abruptly as conditions worsen, adding to the traffic chaos.
4. Rolling blackouts and resource strain. Utilities will likely shut off power in high-risk zones to prevent further ignitions, leaving thousands without electricity or reliable communication. Fire crews will shift from containment to structure defense, stretching resources thin.
5. By Tuesday, LA could feel apocalyptic. Fires doubling in size. Ash falling everywhere. Smoke making the city feel unlivable.

This isn’t a guarantee, but the conditions are all there for this to happen. Fires don’t need to be visible or close to your block to cause chaos. Embers can travel miles ahead of the fireline, sparking new blazes in areas that seem calm today.

LA is walking into a pivotal 48 hours. By the time people realize the scale of what’s happening, it may already feel like a different city.

Edit: Something is not adding up. Apparently we have. PDS in effect but we are opening schools?"

5993,"Thanks for all the work you've put into compiling this report, the effort is much appreciated. 



    A study in Communications Medicine suggests that, for some patients, the drug Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) may help alleviate some symptoms of Long COVID, at least in the short-term. This account from a Long COVID sufferer explains what the experience of Long COVID can be like, and summarizes much of the scientific understanding of the illness. Another study published last week links Long COVID to “neuro-degenerative processes, including Alzheimer’s disease.”




I don't know if it's just me, but it creeps me out more than I can express that so many people seem totally apathetic and blase about this. The implications of this are absolutely terrifying and yet tons of people just waltz around like nothing's wrong, referring to the pandemic in the past tense like it was just a bad year and just going out and risking their health and their lives like they don't mean anything at all. 



    The United States recorded its first human death from bird flu last week in a Louisiana patient. Officials believe the deceased contracted the virus from his/her backyard brood of chickens, which got sick from an interaction with wild birds. One human infection in San Francisco recorded last week seems to have had no known source of infection. Recent human infections are worrying some who believe it will become our next devastating global pandemic.




I'm really hoping bird flu doesn't become a pandemic like covid has, but none of the news I've heard about this has been encouraging-and a lot of it has reminded about what was said about covid before it started spreading widely among people."

kõrge palavik kuni 40 kraadi või rohkem
külmavärinad
peavalu - eriti otsaesises, silmades; tugev valu silmade liigutamisel
lihasvalud - eriti jalgades ja alaseljas

võib olla iiveldus ja oksendamine

Inimesed palun tehke enda selgeks mis asi on gripp.
Iga külmetus ei ole gripp.

Ma eeldan, et enamus inimesi kes räägivad gripistki vormis ei ole kunagi grippi näinud ega kogenud."
6051,"Ega vahet pole kas gripp või nsm külmetus, keegi ei taha haigeks jääda. See et kannad maski kui ise haige oled ja on vaja kuskile kodust välja minna võiks common sense olla."

haiguslehte ei taha kindlasti ükski madalapalgaline võtta, sest kuidas sa siis üldse ellu jääd? eks ise võid ju kartuleid närida terve kuu aga paljudel lapsed/loomad. tundub, et kohe kui inimesel rahaga probleeme pole siis ta unustab kogu enda eelneva elu ära."

Ja linnugripiga on sama teema tõepoolest. ""Evolutsioon on aeglane, rõuged on nobedad"", kui klassikut tsiteerida... Ja nagu näha, mitutuhat aastat ja inimesed pole ikka veel selgeks saanud, et palju rahvast tihedalt koos tähendab haiguste levikut ja arenemist."

6067,"Mul on juba viies aastakümme vaikselt käimas ja mäletan ühte suht hiljutist peaministrit, kelle järjestikkused rapsimisvalitsused tootsid progresseeruvalt rohkem s\*tta, kuni lõpuks ärikvartali altkäemaksuskandaali pärast tuli tasi astuda...

Süüa ning vajadusel ravimeid vaja ikka koju tuua."
6073,Covid ju ei levinud inimeselt-inimesele algselt. Aga see hmpv levib ammu ja tõenäoliselt on suurem osa inimestest põdenud seda.
6074,"On ka vastupidi, liiga tugev immuunsussüsteem - ja covid oli väga hea selle ära kasutamisega.

Agajah, pandeemiatest - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics_and_pandemics on hea loetelu 😀 Kui sullw tundub, et ""iga viie aasta tagant"", siis tõenäoliselt pole sa lihtsalt piisavalt tähelepanu pööranud... Mis on iseenesest täiesti tavaline, enamus inimesi ei tunne huvi maailma vastu, mis konkreetselt nende perset ei torgi, elatakse oma väikeses mullis õndsalt ja ignorantselt 😀"
6087,"Praeguste jamade juurpõhjus on otseselt pekki keeratud riigi majandus ehk võetud rohkem kohustusi, kui jaksatakse välja kanda. Ja neid kohustusi on võtnud viimase 10 aasta jooksul järjest erinevad valitsused ning need kohustused on kuhjunud. Ei saa otseselt ühele ainsale näpuga näidata, et näe see oli paha ja süüdlane.

Aga üheks nendest halbadest otsustest tõepoolest olid II sambaga tehtud lollus."
6088,"Kuidas ei ole? Kas sa saad aru, mida tegi inflatsioonile ja kinnisvaraturule II pensionisamba pappide valimatu vallapäästmine? Mis sa arvad et sellised kinnisvararallid nagu me viimased 5a näinud oleme saavad üldse muidu tekkida?"
6089,"Kui (kuni paari) nädala toidu ette planeerid, siis täiesti arvestatavas osas Eestist tuleb ikka küll, isegi alla keskmise palga puhul - üle poole eestimaalastest elab nt. Rimi teeninduspiirkonnas ja alates 60€ tellimusest tuuakse see sulle tasuta koju kätte."
6090,Peale ravimite ostmist ei jää ju midagi üle :D
6091,"Üks osa, aga mitte kõik. Praegune valitsus on ikka väga suuri lolluseid teinud."
6092,Koroonat mäletad?
6093,"Meil terve hunnik inimesi, kes arvutist midagi ei jaga :)"
6094,"Ning kui tellida veel 60-päevane kojuveopakett 4.99 eest, siis telli nii tihti kui soovid min. 20 eurose ostukorviga."
6095,"Praegune valitsus on olnud ametis vähem kui pool aastat. Kui sa mõtled, et praegune koalitsioon, siis minu arust oli neile peamine kriitika (mida ma jagan), et nad ei ole piisavalt palju üldse midagi teinud."
6096,"Kõik valitsused teevad kellegi arvates lollusi. Kokku lugeda neid, siis praegune koosseis on neid jõudnud vähem teha, kui eelnevad omaette, rääkimata sellest kuipalju eelnevad summarselt neid teinud on.   Ja selle sitahunniku alt välja kaevamine võtab palju tööd mitte ei käi üleöö."
6097,"Sry aga koroonatoetused on suht kökimöki võrreldes sellega, et mingi iga neljas inimene sai 30-60K EUR pihku."
6098,Veel suurem hulk on kes ei jaga telekast ka midagi kuid ikka vaatavad 🤷
6099,"Tähenärimine.
Aga mõnikord on mittetegemine ja lisaks väga suur maksude tõstmine laastavam kui ..."
6100,"Koroona toetus :D ? Jutt ei ole sellest, vaid mõjust majandusele ..."
6101,"Maksude tõstmine on olnud küllaltki väike.  Või õigem oleks öelda, et sa pole suurt maksude tõstmist kohanud."
6102,"Eesti majanduse suurim probleem on juba viimased 3-4 aastat olnud inflatsioon ja sellega kaasas käiv elukalliduse tõus. Koroona ajal majandus kasvas suure hüppega, kui pensionifondide rahad hakkasid turult kinnisvara kokku ostma: https://tradingeconomics.com/estonia/gdp Kahjuks geeniused ei suutnud ette näha, et see toob kaasa korraliku majanduspohmelli.

Asjad, mis on elukallidust palju rohkem mõjutanud kui koroona:

* Venemaa kallaletung Ukrainale (kallimad kaubad, kaotatud investeeringud, tohutu tõus energiahindades)
* Pensionifondidest kohalikule kinnisvaraturule möllama lastud rahad
* Imelikud maksutõusud, mille eesmärk oleks justkui julgeolekukulutuste finantseerimine, aga mis on selgelt nii käiku antud, et pärast saaks nende eest kasvõi valitsuse palku maksta kui vaja"

Now, people will start associating these regular symptoms with the new HMPV virus, and then the media takes it further, doing what it does best"

6199,XD
6200,It'll dip more into negative numbers.
6201,😂😂😅
6202,its a domino effect - media creates unnecessary hype saying how similar this is to COVID. Hence the public tend to panic
6203,"“China virus” Fear mongering by indian media, just watch any indian news channel’s youtube video regarding this virus and you’ll get to experience 3 minutes of intense music followed by clips of people in hospital followed by sensational headlines, some shit like “bachiye aap aya corona ka bap”"
6204,"Yeah but this was in the first week of the month when the sips are supposed to flow in, this is concerning."
6205,Asli ID se aao chinese government
6206,"Whoever controls media controls people’s minds. 

Indian media should be non-existent and ignored. Sadly either of those things are not going to happen."
6207,"Agreed, we are in a correction phase."

6209,Then you finish your funds. And the real dip arrives.
6210,"Keep buying the dip, then the dip of the dip, Stacking those coins, got a wallet that’s thick. When the market drops, I don’t lose my grip, I’m a crypto shark, not a panic ship.

Ride the waves low, then I soar to the top, Every red candle’s just fuel for the plot. Dippity dip, yeah, I’m filling my stash, When the bulls come back, I’m swimming in cash.

Keep it cool, gotta play the long game, Patience in the pocket, profits my aim. From the dip to the dip to the dippity dive, I’m stacking my assets, watch 'em come alive!

6211,what to buy in dip.. equity??
6212,If not tomorrow then the day after tomorrow?
6213,"Definitely not. Massive selling will happen throughout the month by everyone to protect whatever funds they have. Don't forget valuations are extremely high, especially in the midcaps. They can fall by 25% quite easily in a few days. And then Trump's tariffs is extremely negative for India."
6214,Idk as such for HMPV. But i am bullish on the pharma industry in the next 1-2 months.
6215,Marksans pharma will cross 300 as per my research.
6216,Bro i went all in when nifty fell -1% ..now i have no cash left and nifty is about to hit -2%🤑

6219,Punjabi aagye oye
6220,you can use reddit in China??
6221,Some support around 1700 level
6222,Good coverage. But i don’t think suddenly the market will fall due to trump. We already knew he would be coming from last few weeks and market has increased since then as well.
6223,"With Trump coming, it is good for India. No one is looking at the fact that the tariffs are country specific, and not winder generic tariffs. people pick up a word from the stupid media and run with it. the tariffs are on china, canada, mexico. not on india. first get your facts straight.

Trump coming will be good for india. as rupee against dollar falls, indian stocks will be more attractive per dollar as they get more worth for each dollar. so they will rush into the indian markets more. the fall is to recover dollars right now, so that when rupee goes down, as it will, they are pump in the money in dollars more. So markets will rally in a few months once rupee cross 90-95 mark.

Indian budget is something that only indians panic over. FII dont bother much as they can take their money elsewhere anytime. The budget will frankly be worse, cause the push is to make the markets more reliant on the country's money and not FII. For that you need ways to reduce FII dependency on the stock market prices. so in the short run markets will fall but FII will lose more if they pull back.

HMPV is nothing like COVID - but markets will immediately bounce back if they fall - no one took COVID seriously in the beginning, and then we all saw what happened. No surprises there.

The real thing to worry about - the housing bubble in US. 2007-08 crash soon to repeat - debt is at all time high. US employment data has been manipulated left and right. Student loans and housing loans ballooning up but real data is not being shown - its waiting for Trump to come. Jan-end is when the BLS will release employment data for the Dec-24 quarter end. Markets likely to crash in Feb-Apr period. about 40%.

  
But out of all these - something amazing will come.  IDK what it is yet, but something wonderful will come out of all these."

A Haiku is generally composed of five-seven-five syllables in three lines (five in the first line, seven in the second, and five in the third).

6269,"What are the odds? Are we going to do this every winter? Should we react to the news of every flu outbreak?

There are better reasons for the Nifty50 to fall by 5%. HMPV will not even be a catalyst."
6270,"Thanks for your kind words,
You explained it really well,
I understand now"
6271,"First of all, it’s not artificial. It’s a part of the game. Second, if INR gets to that level, NRI will remit much more than usual like they did after Covid to get more for their investments, hence stabilizing the rupee. IMO, I don’t think it’ll get to the 90s mark in the short term."
6272,Useless arguing with someone who can't understand how economics work. Don't bother wasting your time.
6273,I think now you lost me. The issue is you assuming that INR will lose its value almost 10% in 2 months timespan. I’m just saying you went overboard a little bit grandpa.
6274,"No they are same as Mutual funds (but in ETF they all are Passive Mutual funds which track index). I presume in long term they should give CAGR of 12-15% (my expectation)

Also, ETFs/MFare 75% of my portfolio (for safe side). Gold 5%. Rest 20% I buy blue chip stocks which are valued correctly (in high quantity) like HCL, DrReddy, Natco, TataPower, Motors, KalyanJewel (holding 100@77) etc… and valuation stocks which has been in sideways for long time (like IDFC)

As per my individual stock picking, I don’t go towards stocks where valuation is bursted though fundamentally they look strong (eg,. Won’t be entering Dixon or DMart or Asian paints or Trent or Titan for eg,. until they correct at my levels of buying)"

Ever since they started the fasting pill delivery service, i havent need to leave my cave. All this time pondering the dao has lead me to realize we are just in an illusion.

6292,"Fellow Daioist's time to go to seclusion again. Will see you after reaching the golden core realm. If I can't achieve the higher realm my lifespan will end in the utmost 1.5 years.

6306,"Inspired by Squid Games, sponsored by Netflix"
6307,"Eta ekhono confirmed news noy, let's wait and see.

  
Even if it's true, there's a fundamental difference between HMPV and SARS-CoV2 (the virus behind CoViD). Unlike CoV, which was a new and yet unforeseen virus, HMPV is well known. HMPV was first isolated in 2001, and scientists have discovered that the virus and infection has been around for at least 50 years before that. In fact, HMPV is the 2nd leading cause of respiratory diseases amongst children in the US. Although no vaccine is available yet, Moderna did Phase 1 trials of a candidate vaccine back in 2019, before being pushed back due to the CoViD outbreak.

So we are better prepared to tackle HMPV than we were for CoV. No need to panic yet."

Second it’s not fatal like Covid till now, it affects only infants n old people. If we adults get that, doctors told to treat like normal virus."
6417,"The thing is, there's nothing to panic about this mild flu.
It's been there for many years and more cases will be reported as we're screening for it more. 
For example, you can go to the beach and come empty handed but if you search for sea shells specifically you'll always find more!
Take respiratory precautions if you're at risk by wearing mask and proper cough and sneeze etiquette (sigh)."

6419,"I personally feel. Covid was more serious in a way that 7-8/10 developed pneumonia during second wave (CT scores atleast 4/25) that is the reason why hospitalisations were rampant. 

HMPV should have already spread across the world as there have been no restrictions on overseas travel and yet there has not been any outbreaks as rampant as COVID in any country. 

We had Peru seeing a tsunami of deaths in 2021 Feb even before India developed it's second wave. This virus or for that reason any virus can cause issues to people with complications."

I just don't, not anymore. If they end up dying, that's perfectly fine with me and I definitely won't lose any sleep over it. I saw way too many people who did everything they could to avoid catching COVID, end up dying as a result of the gross callousness of others. 

I don't give 2 shits if you think I'm an asshole but that kind of logic you employed over RSV or any other respiratory virus for that matter is exactly the reason why this country continues to struggle with stuff like this and will likely see emerging threats become endemic for the foreseeable future.

HMPV also is the virus which has been in our world through 60 years and isn't really concerning virus. Instead it's a mild one and can be dealt with easily.
Plus the cases which are recorded in India and the ones infected don't have any travel history either, again proving the point that the virus would just show up randomly.

Last but not least, HMPV isn't new like COVID was so there is no reason to panic and start a pandemic warning.

Although I would like to be wrong here and see if the Virus is mutated and completely different that what all the doctors say about."
6567,Yeh though it was found in 2001 so it's completely not serious if seen that way. The only reason I think there's a chance of spreading like COVID is just because it comes from China. They can mutate it to make its variations which can cause confusion and won't give us time to react.
6568,"Yeah, that's what I said the mutation is the only way this virus could cause Covid2.0. Just hope that the mutated one doesn't actually come true, pray for the ones who can't and aren't ready to deal with this virus and the ones who lost their families in COVID."

6584,Actually my boss got sick returning form Shanghai last week and it is HMPV
6585,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world."

6587,Lmao my coworkers are coughing their lungs out

6591,"Ccp claim China is a first world nation, meanwhile it's a plague ridden dystopian nightmare that repeatedly infects the whole planet with deadly viruses"
6592,LOCK IT DOWN! Does no one think of the poor elderly?? Plus 3 weeks mandatory quarantine for travelers should be the absolute minimum we can do. Also install 50cm high plastic barriers between all dining tables immediately. Stupid Western countries who dont do this will have MILLIONS of deaths!
6593,Yes this is seasonal as it does spread more in colder months. But this is a larger spike in cases than what is expected in terms of data from previous years which has been picked up on. Although this spike is still in the range where it isn't considered an outlier in cases and is believed by experts to be in the normal range at the moment. Unlike Corona virus this is not a novel virus. This means most people have some sort of immunity to it. Obviously everyone should try and stay hygienic by washing hands often and staying inside when sick as nobody likes getting ill.
6594,China needs to be wiped off the earth.  
6595,Falun Gong garbage / fake news
6596,"Exactly this. This makes me chuckle. I was going to quote that passage here but thankfully someone’s already done it.

They make it sound like it’s something completely abnormal and as though masks are only a sign of some catastrophe like that of COVID-19, as they also forget that face masks are commonplace in Beijing and other metropolises where air quality is (or used to be) usually low."
6597,Crowded hospitals with people wearing masks… it’s just your regular Tuesday in any hospital in China.
6598,Hospitals also crowded year-round too.
6599,"Yet.

Have we forgotten that China locked down their country as well for covid which at that point globally was considered pretty much harmless?

This isn't a country where science prevails, ideology time after time comes first."

6603,But mainstream media told us covid killed the flu. Now the flu is miraculously back?
6604,"It is doing the rounds in some areas (I am in Jiangsu, and loads of people are sick with a bronchial-type illness right now), but it's basically just a nasty flu if you do get it, but certain parts of the media are hyping it up because China + virus = clicks."

>Cases of human metapneumovirus, or HMPV, spiked this spring, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s respiratory virus surveillance systems. It filled hospital intensive care units with young children and seniors who are the most vulnerable to these infections.

>Most people who caught it probably didn’t even know they had it, however. Sick people aren’t usually tested for it outside of a hospital or ER.

>When the researchers tested blood samples from 72 patients that had been stored since 1958, all showed evidence of exposure to the mystery virus, indicating that it had been circulating in humans, undetected, for at least the previous half-century.

>The infection generates weak or incomplete immune protection, however, and humans get reinfected throughout their lives.


HMPV have been circulating among humans for decades, no one knew nor cared to know b/c it caused little fatalities.  

When was the last time you had a cold?  Chances are it was either rhinovirus, HMPV or RSV."

6680,I had this in 2014. Was insanely sick- fever of 104. Fevers came and went for a week. It was awful
6681,"Pretty sure I had this a month ago. I worked in an urgent care so had access to all the usual tests which were negative. One of the nurse practitioners I worked with got it as well and thought it was some kind of pneumovirus. I felt better after sleeping for 3 days and taking it easy for 2 more. Still coughing stuff up though.

If you notice a weird tickle in your throat, that's how it started for my coworkers and I. I have also never sweated more in my life while sick."
6682,Treated a child with this. The uncontrollable fevers were wild. And resps of 100. Scary shit
6683,Important or not I will die any day now. My two year anniversary of my vaccination is quickly approaching.
6684,"My 7yo daughter had this last year, we are in Australia. She was incredibly sick - I thought she had Covid for the first time but it was Human Metapneumovirus. Almost 2 weeks off school, high fevers and very unwell it was awful. I’m sorry it’s going around in the northern hemisphere now and feel for anyone who will be unwell with it (and hope it doesn’t make its way back here to spike again over the next few months)🙏"

I hope you feel better too!!"
6706,"I am on day 10 of this nightmare.  I can’t even talk or I go into coughing fit.  At night the coughing is so bad I am gagging and almost throw up.   I have asthma.  I am on prednisone, antibiotic for sinus infection, Allegra D.  I really see very minimal improvement. Not sleeping because of the cough, the lack of restorative sleep doesn’t help the body fight the virus.  Wishing you all a quick recovery from this."
6707,That was my situation but I was on Zyrtec and Flonase on top of a rescue inhaler and I was using my nebulizar to help breathe. Finally cleared up when we were in Puerto Rico last week. Def felt like forever
6708,"I’m on day five. I work from home and felt it was ridiculous to take time off so I’ve worked through minor things. I’ve worked a total of 8 hours this week and have had to use PTO because this has me feeling absolutely awful. I had Covid once and this has been worse given the symptoms. 

Covid I had a few hours of what felt like labor pains in my hips and lower back for one day. Was fine the rest of the time. I thought it was COVID and tested myself twice but came back negative."

Fast forward in case you missed Covid, another neat clusterfuck that lasted 3 years actively and even today is being played off what truly happened.

So people being concerned and/or questioning what's going on is pretty understandable. Certainly after China let Covid go global causing millions of deaths without notice while having plenty of data on hands, and if countries questioned what went on they faced economical and political retaliation. 

If China played open card, they would publish how many cases in big cities are going on, how many people are infected and allow people to draw their own conclusions, but guess what, that's not happening now is it? And personally I can't even help to wonder, just like Covid, does China really know what's going on."

You are making a basic nomenclature mistake pretending to be some gotcha.

>A study in New York conducted over four winters found that it was as common in hospitalized seniors as RSV and the flu.

6856,">there is a level of variant to variant

Sure, but why is it a cause for concern when it’s reported in China when the virus has been circulating in the population for at least 2 decades since identification but possibly even longer?

Is it extra scrutiny or prejudice?

There was a recent warning here in the U.S. about increase infection of RSV especially among children.  There was a spike in RSV cases but it barely made the rounds online.

Why such huge discrepancies in alert when multiple variants of RSV exists and is a common infection like HMPV?

>HPMV is not a non-issue

No infection is a non-issue as there is always a chance of complications.  RSV is not nor is the flu.  It is though very common as most people might have already caught it and most people that do catch it include children will experience a cold.

However there is an usual amount of concern and biased assumptions both in comment, posting and media when conclusions from actual health experts seems to be regular seasonal occurrence"

6860,"Yep they can do their own research. 

However, if you fail to see why people might be nervous about being told “there’s a virus circulating in China but it’s nothing to worry about” then maybe you are underestimating the trauma that covid caused."
6861,"If you're going to be elevating this to the level of actual scientific nomenclature I'll have to correct you. This isn't intended as a ""gotcha"", but it feels like you're presenting yourself as more of an authority on the subject right now rather than just some guy in a mud slinging match online so it's important to get it right.

COVID is an abbreviation for **CO**rona**VI**rus **D**isease. It is not a genus and has nothing to do with scientific nomenclature. It was a convenient name to use so people didn't keep panicking whenever the acronym SARS came up. COVID-19 was caused by *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* (so the genus is *Betacoronavirus*), which is the same species which caused SARS in 2001.

Forcing us to get all scientific here rams the point home. *Human metapneumovirus* is a species isolated in 2001. *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* is a species which caused an epidemic in 2001. Yes, they both already have existed in humans for some time, that doesn't mean new variants don't appear (as the new variant which caused COVID-19 suddenly appeared). Nobody is saying it has, or will, but aren't we being a bit obtuse to pretend there's nothing familiar about a species of virus from 2001 suddenly spreading out of control in China after we JUST got over a pandemic caused by another species of virus from 2001 spreading out of control in China?

An active bird flu epidemic that has already decimated large stock of poultry, infected cattle and already infected several workers in contact with said animals.

It’s not if but when this current variant of bird flu will jump species while research of HMPV would reveal that it’s a common seasonal infection right behind RSV."

6878,The fact is China covered it up and continues to hide and lie about data. It deleted everything even though the whole world knows it came from China. It arrested and made the first doctor to report on it sign a confession that he was lying and creating panic. That same doctor that later died as hero in exposing China to the world for its coverup.

6881,">it’s more like calling a Golden a German

No it’s not.

HMPV is a single stranded RNA virus while Influenza is a single stranded segmented RNA virus.

The segmentation in influenza is what gives it high evolution and mutational rate.

Influenza also produces unique hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin-esterase fusion that’s uniquely influenza and not found in HMPV.

They are all viruses but they are vastly different, appear different and have different genetics.

A flu is specifically caused by influenza and no other virus"
6882,">google released lab Wuhan

Sure, none of which is peer reviewed and gathered in a scientific practice.  Google US lab release and you can find articles of allegations of US releasing the virus.  

>are you suggesting it’s a coincidence a lab

The U.S. CDC is founded in Florida because the scientists want to go to south beach.

CDC was founded in Florida because it was the epicenter of malaria and other tropical borne diseases so it would be easier for the CDC to collect samples and deploy remedies.

If your lab research is about ice caps, you don’t build your lab in the middle of a desert.  If your lab is about emerging zoonotic infections, you build your lab where there has been historical high occurrence of such outbreak.  

Just because a lab is built doesn’t mean we can predict and control all new cross species outbreaks.  No one can tell when a novel microbes is going to jump species and start infecting humans."

Layman here, but still...

As far as I understand, it's natural killer cells that eat viruses and neutrophils that go after bacteria. Killer T cells can attack both, but they need antigen tags to work and so take a bit longer. I know that the lymphocytes increased by viral infection are different enough from those increased in bacterial infection that specifically viral infections can provoke both onset and attacks of autoimmune disease. Or at least there's a not insignificant correlation that does not exist for bacterial illness.

The idea that the immune cells are too tired after fighting one kind of infection that it can't fight another sort. Not how it works and they largely aren't the same immune cells.

6941,"Actually that is a great over-head break down of it. Go home and tell your mother you’re brilliant!  

Also happy cake day."
6942,This was actually a great explanation
6943,"Yeah. It’s so bad it’s almost like “This has to be intentional, right?”. My elementary grade child knows better than anything he explained."
6944,You've hit on a brilliant idea here. I think the CDC needs to get Ms Frizzle to start doing PSA cartoons about each virus that comes along. I had to explain to my family that norovirus is impervious to alcohol sanitizers and that the only way to get rid of/break  them is through good old soap and water handwashing.
6945,"Based on what the said, I think he over paid."
6946,Yeah. That broke me. I’m just glad my coworkers are used to me laughing randomly at the stuff I listen to. This was my personal “They burn to the fucking ground Eddie” moment.
6947,"But they never believe it when a gal says the same thing, LOL. ;)"
6948,"He kept calling the P in HMPV “pneumonia” when it’s “pneumo”. The first is a condition, the latter is an organ (lung). That aggravated me."
6949,"As I was listening to him all I could think about was the quote from Billy Madison. 

“At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”"
6950,"Well, he was always a dentist..."
6951,"He puts in effort. I mean, it can't be easy to be completely full of shit and get away with it for 30 years.  He's a good showman and broadcaster. That's hard work, believe it or not. He just sucks at being an actual journalist and commentator."
6952,When he asked his friend for a +1?
6953,"And with a gold star bind them... in the state that's occupied, where the show-host lies.

Yay!

Now I'm dreaming of being able to force him to learn about the innate and the adaptive immune system, how that'd break his brain and how he'd break the learning in return. I mean, I love how it'd mean he'd know more about how vaccines as well as allergies work. As well as how ""reducing the immune system"" is actually good for some people. (If what he's said about covid shots was right, auto-immune world be excitedly crowing about it to this day!)

But then, how would he screw it up? Definitely going to conflate natural killer cells, natural killer t-cells, and killer t-cells all to heck. Maybe even t-cells generally as a bonus. Bet ""natural killer cells"" would become the baddies, which is funny because they're definitely a hero here, but misidentifying hero and villain is Alex all over, itn't it? And it would prove he's fighting on the side of not just covid, but viruses generally (and cancer to boot, right?) Ha! Memory cells, though, those would be awfully enticing. There's memory b's and memory t's... which he'd definitely screw up. Both the linguistically plausible combinations could be useful to him. He'll have a greater amount of memory P cells, P for prophecy through which god grants him his powers. And papa will be able to increase everyone's memory d cells through vitamin sales, right? 

Ah well. Maybe just force him to listen to Mark Crislip's good ole [QuackCast 22](http://www.pusware.com/quackcast/quackcast22.mp3), ""Boost your immune system. And die."" Half a dozen times, min, maybe?"
6954,I’m an infectious disease clinician… I’m right there with you
6955,That may be one of my all time favorite lines from Knowledge Fight
6956,"I transcribed it and sent it to people, like, every now and then I'll send them, ""A Moment of Alex"" when he goes really off the rails because people don't know what he's LIKE."
6957,When he snuck in there 25 years ago
6958,"Is that the one where he yells about how he was still on the sidewalk, and thus not trespassing on the property? Really great work Alex."
6959,"I don't remember that part, but they did actually go into the Grove & get footage out. It's the only thing approaching real & dangerous journalism that he ever did—which is why whenever he's feeling down on himself, he'll bring it up as proof he's important."
6960,I believe the incident you're referencing was him trying to go to Bilderberg. Bohemian Grove I think he did get into.
6961,"Yes, this."
6962,"Ahh, but it is new! In the geological sense."
6963,"What's kind of amusing is they claimed Covid was the flu because it was a convenient claim to make at the time.

Now they're claiming HMPV is some new dangerous disease, when it's usually just a mild cold, because again, it's convenient. 

[https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22443-human-metapneumovirus-hmpv](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22443-human-metapneumovirus-hmpv)

\*Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus that usually causes symptoms similar to a cold. You might cough or wheeze, have a runny nose or a sore throat. Most cases are mild, but young children, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for serious illness. HMPV is common — most people get it before they turn 5.\*"
6964,Also many of those children are Chinese.

7080,This is so disgusting piece of shit westerners
7081,Don't interact with such people. They don't know how to disagree without being disagreeable.
7082,"Something I don’t understand about Chinese people is why you keep arguing with such population. China is probably the most liked and respected country in the global south, people talk about it as the example everyone should follow for development and they defend it as much as they can, but the average Chinese is too focused combating Sinophobia in western spheres to realize how much they’re liked everywhere else"
7083,"Don't worry.  Even if the US heads towards war with China all I can say is china will win even if the States doesn't implode first with its deep seated civil war esque issues which I think it will. Well over half of its own denizens wants to see all the Trump voters burn.  Also because the us has been busy fucking around with anything but infrastructure it won't have the ability to counter a country that will soon have the best infrastructure, technology and ability to counter threats due to an organized and relatively happy population.  China isn't at the point where it can roflstomp the west but it will be because she is effectively feeding her own people.  She's made incredible strides and I believe some of the greatest minds will prefer the ethos of China over the us which is in an accelerated decline especially after this most recent election.  Bombs, guns, bullying and war is the way of the west.  Technology, speed, progress, and advancement is the way of the east.  China has nurtured her poorest, brought them out of famine and despite the fact xijingping has been in office forever you can't disagree with the incredible advancements the country has made.  Frankly if they could have made Biden a forever president I would have voted for that.  Too bad Dems are too woke to realize that you can't win a war with cheaters by playing fair...."
7084,"LMAO. Racist? Be fucking proud that your country is being called the most racist country. Do you want Mainland China to become another shithole like majority of countries in Europe? The white population has been decreasing and decreasing because of what? Check the amount of illegals there, you will know why. If ""Kind-Fan420"" is white, then just ask him how does it feel to have your native country being taken over by bunch of non-whites, there are literally sharia laws in UK LMAOOO. 🤣🤣🤣"
7085,I’ve never seen anyone say nuke Russia before. Reason why?
7086,Yeah the average person does not think like this about China.
7087,This should kind of clue you in that most people in the West are just straight up racist. It’s not just the “keyboard warriors” - it’s the majority of them. They just don’t say it to your face.

7097,"No, it isn't. The virus has been around for decades it is making a big surge, but that isn't unusual either. Since covid countries monitor viruses heavily. The result is more information. 

More information leads to more news. Unfortunately, this gives people a chance to  jump to conclusions very easy and to spread fear. You will be fine the virus is not the next pandemic."
7098,"HMPV is seasonal and is essentially just a common cold. This isn’t a conspiracy, it’s fear mongering."

7101,I have no idea what virus I have had since Dec 12 - but the cough by has bruised my ribs and diaphragm and ruptured ovarian cysts. But I’ll tell you what - no one is jabbing me or masking me or shutting things down. My immune system is working and it’s a 💩virus but so what. Don’t let them do it again.
7102,The next “pandemic” will not be a single virus. It will rather be a collection of continuously changing/ongoing public health threats. Welcome to pandemonium.

7139,Isn't this just another version of the cold? Or is that a different one I'm thinking about.

7143,New Covid?
7144,"Normal symptoms are like a mild cold. Severe cases, you can get bronchitis. This isn't shit."
7145,"Definitely not, because we don’t comply"
7146,"I remember being in Facebook and seeing so make fake weird diseases coming from china, and thinking COVID was another one in 2019 🤣🤣🤣 Im thinking this is the same fake weird one but COVID won't help with the fearing people"
7147,It’s almost 2030. Outbreak in 5 years.
7148,Just trying to get panic. Nothing burger.
7149,A whole bunch of fucking nothing.
7150,People make more money fearmongering off of Bill Gates and “plandemic” hysteria and historical erasure of natural trends than bill gates ever made off of a vaccine.
7151,"Isn't this like the 20th ""new Chinese virus"" in the 12 months?

None of them are even new"
7152,"It's disappointing that no-one in this group seems aware of (or probably interested in) just how strong the no-virus position is. But it's the same on Facebook and it was the same when I tried to explain it to local protesters on Telegram way back when. 
Only people who already understand the arguments are interested, which makes it an echo chamber. Everyone else seems to think it's just a whimsical notion with no substance to it - a bit like the way I see flat earth really.
I find this hard to understand because, even if I hadn't heard the evidence and thought the idea of viruses not existing was both unnecessary and silly, given the momentous importance of the idea of the off-chance that it was true, I'd at least want to give it a hearing. But most people don't seem to see it like that."
7153,"News like fear because sales. They are fucked.

We understand as a society that there will always be a new pandemic coming because of how quickly mutations occur in these kinds of things.

Be alert but not alarmed."
7154,I just think it’s funny that China is always brought up.
7155,"Is this similar to HPV? If so, I’ve had it several times and should have the antibodies already."
7156,Time to buy GME and all Krypto coins
7157,Another “china” virus eh?
7158,If it hasn’t been enhanced in a lab it’s nothing to worry about.
7159,Bullshit just like Covid nothing else
7160,"We always knew they were coming back for more.

Walmart never going back to 24hrs said it all. 

Good thing I've still got my ""*F medical fascism*"" decorations up."
7161,"my sources confirm this , this has already been set in motion, people I know in Turkey in the know have shared this , tighten up, it won't be as gnarly as the last one , but it will still reduce mobility in half , isolate troublesomes, and decrease flaring in social settings , delay tactics , that is all"
7162,"Oh man, who is dumb enough to fall for this shit again?... ok a lot of npc people will"
7163,"These posts are just as bad as the MSM pushing ""Next Pandemic"" bullshit. Stop fueling the fire folks. 

I've seen more about this virus on conspiracy subs then the MSM actually."
7164,Sources: clickbait website nobody ever heard of. X. YouTube YouTube.
7165,"From your first article

""HMPV is not a new virus or an imminent pandemic threat.""

>We also have the SPARS 2025 another Pandemic tabletop exercise predicting a outbreak in 2025.

Tabletop exercises *don't* *predict things*"
7166,It's a new mutation of an old virus. It's this or california bird flu. Congo disease kind of gone quiet.
7167,Meme it
7168,"You are right OP, i just spoke with Bill Gates, and he told me we 're all dead in the next few weeks. Luckily, he felt bad for me, because i started crying, and he gave me the varxcine. Since i will live, i think its best you sign over all of your assets to me, i will make sure to take good care of them."
7169,Why are we upvoting this crap
7170,"I was going to say. After how controversial Covid was and how recent it was, o don't think they'd just go all out with another one. People are far more skeptical now too but who knows"
7171,Covid existed for a long time as well
7172,so was Sars lol. Quit deflecting
7173,💯
7174,I just want to know when interest rates are gonna drop
7175,"Came here to say that I've read numerous times from supposed doctors/nurses that this has been in the US for a very long time. 

So many people that post in this sub are extremely ignorant and are the exact opposite of ""critical thinkers""."
7176,"Just goes to show you how the media is nothing but propaganda. I mean how do people willfully remain so blind. I'm genuinely curious. I must have 100 levels of awareness beyond most bc this shit doesn't even phase me /s. Some of us really do have intuition built up from years of studying the patterns. It's second nature for me to know what's being pushed. And really these days. It's nearly all of it pushed as main stream news. So no,  not really that hard to be so ""special"" . You just have to have a little more awareness and like I'm not even that special imo so it's just sad people are so dumb is my conclusion."
7177,"How long has the weaponized version been around? 

What lab did it escape from? 

What pharmaceutical stock can I buy for the vaccine?"
7178,that’s what they said about covid. you don’t know sh*t.
7179,"No, the real virus is the friends we made along the way 🤗"
7180,"It would make sense if they used multiple viruses at the same time, assuming they are going ahead with it this year when you consider that one minute their are articles about bird flu, now it's this virus and others have been used in the past like Monkeypox as well. They could just be trying to confuse people so they can't be easily prepared. I will give them this, it sure is confusing me lol."
7181,quad... llke the 4 horsemen...   people will go mad.
7182,nah it'll be real this time. I'm guessing that the h5N1 vaxxine or whatever will be in fact medically necessary to survive in public but it'll still have bad stuff
7183,"would one small donut entice you to take an experimental, liability-less RNA shot? I promise you'll get to post a picture of you and the donut on your social media platform of choice."
7184,This is literally not a pandemic though so this comment is pretty silly.
7185,yes! and then an actual pandemic is released. happens either way. listen to the ether and whatever help is guided.
7186,"Diseases are fake now folks. If you’re sick, no you’re not, this guy said so."
7187,"I didn't really mind it here in the UK bh. I knew it was a scam, but it didn't personally affect me that much."
7188,I'm still working on my supply from the Covid days.
7189,"Didn't have to the first time. You obviously are one who chose to. Remember,  they can NOT force us to do anything."
7190,Kung Flu is back on the table.
7191,"🎶 ""The HuMP-V dance is your chance to do the...""🎶 

I'll see myself out."
7192,might be the coding of it
7193,It causes similar symptoms and usually not serious
7194,They're always warning us about 'disease x'. I don't think they can have thought it through or they should have started at A.
7195,"All they have to say is that it's affecting/killing children. I think they found out that geriatrics weren't garnering enough sympathy for folks to submit to the destruction of their way of life.  


But anyone who has a kid will sure as hell take it seriously. Which is ~70% of American adults.  "
7196,"Yes but when everyone has lost trust in the media, CDC, who, politicians etc wouldn't that be the perfect conditions to actually wreck us? If everyone is skeptical they're not going to stay home, cancel schools, they could use the boy who cried wolf mentality against us. Idk I'm just saying, it's possible. Just be prepared and pay attention if something does come out, but let's hope it doesn't come to that. "
7197,thank you.
7198,"Soon, trump will handle it."
7199,the one bill gates is buying
7200,"No covid, they weren't quite sure what it was at first. This one we definitely know what it is. Give in too the fear mongers if you want but you are only hurting yourself."
7201,♥️ Captain Trips 4EVA    ♥️
7202,"Nah they're just keeping this virus bullshit on a backburner ready to heat it up and make it into another ""pandemic"" when they feel like the time is right or they need a reason to shut down society again. This shit is always going to come back it's way too powerful for them to give up considering how well it went last time."
7203,"The OP titled the post as the ""new pandemic"". Is the responding comment silly or OP?"
7204,"Bro we had record number of deaths that our government lowered through corruption because they didnt put a real lockdown in place. I personally know 2 very healthy men that died way too early from covid. Me on the other hand, I never had any trouble and never tested positive despite being 5 times close to people with covid, spending multiple hours with them, touching etc. 

Even when I had to take care of my father and mother from covid I tested negatively. Im saying that not to disprove the infection but rather to say that everyone reacted differently. 

Imo the pandemic wasnt a hoax but it was lab made. Weather it was intended or just an accident, thats what im currently seeking"
7205,Can I bum some  😆 🤣 😂
7206,"They used a lot of force last time, and people ended up in jail for violating mask mandates on trespassing + resisting charges."
7207,"They tried that with Covid too. People would
Wait until they actually saw it this time… maybe that’s the plan?!"
7208,"correct.. but not ""gain of function"" coronavirus..  so is this ""gain of function"" HMPV?    i dunno, just asking.     hes not fear mongering... they want to do another pandemic 100%...  its a matter of when and if people will follow it or not."
7209,🤣
7210,"The point is that this is no way comparable to the Corona, it's existed in the US for decades.

Coronavirus freaked the government out for a reason. They were very aware of how dangerous it was because they took part in making it. It was a lab leak that they refused to admit to and knew the potential consequences."
7211,"I've no idea what your friends died of - possibly allowing themselves to go on ventilators and be given Remdesivir. All I know is that one person's anecdote doesn't outweigh the overwhelming evidence that it was a scam.
As for your belief that it was lab made.. it's nothing but a cliché to me. Obviously, the originality of an opinion has no necessary relation to its truth value, but I'm not particularly interested in opinions per se. I'm interested in the strength of whatever evidence people can present for them.
The only evidence I've heard for gain of function theory is that there were some patents and the genome didn't look natural, but since you can patent anything whether it exists or not, and since the genome was not sequenced from purified virus, I don't find any of that compelling."
7212,Your point is what? You DID NOT HAVE TO COMPLY. I never did or will do.
7213,"We dont even have remdesivir. It wasnt a medicine distributed here. The hospitals here were a joke honestly and maltreated covid. Both that died went to the hospital very late in the process. The doctors I personally knew and one of them saved my life twice said so. I had no doubts in that mans integrity, peace be upon his soul. 

I dont think anything ill say will change your opinion if the virus was real or a hoax, but i knew plenty that lost someone or had serious issues from it. Also as mentioned earlier had 5 different occassions, 15~ people with covid around me and 5 which I had to take care of, my parents, sister and husband and other sisters husband. My other sister had 0 symptoms like me. 

I have 2 others in my family that died during covid, one died from heart related problems and covid pulled the last straw, the otherone from covid but was very old 79-80. Even tho in amazing health before it."
7214,"My point is that ""they can NOT force us"" is objectively false when they did successfully force us and no one's been held accountable.  Not that I approve of that, but let's not forget that it happened.  Attitudes need to change before it happens again."
7215,It wouldn't have happened if you just said no. How hard is that to understand?
7216,[removed]
7217,Noooo. I don't want another lockdown. That virus better stay there.
7218,"Last time, They f*cked my school life and now they are planning to f*ck my college life"

7330,"I'm a simple man, I see baby driver, I like."
7331,Ooooh gladiator! That would be a sick one.
7332,"Awesome. I bought my first 4K in 2020, and now I've got about 150. Welcome. It's a fun ride."
7333,Just wait until you get a slipcover fetish.
7334,Why you blurred the prices ?
7335,I have the same matrix cover. I honestly thought that i got a pirated copy or something but no that is the one of offical covers of the 1999 movie.  I prefer the older one.
7336,"Nice list, Baby Driver and Blade Runner are my go-to's for showing off 4k. Reference quality for sure"
7337,The 2049 disc is one of the best I have. Turn it up loud and ascend to heaven. I saw it again at the cinema last night and I’ll always defend the cinema over at home viewing but I gotta say that the disc looked better than the file they were projecting on the big screen. Welcome to the hive of hmv supporters!
7338,Nice set!  Blow dryer to those stickers pronto!
7339,How do you like The Matrix in 4K? I just bought it on bluray and am wondering if I should’ve gotten it in 4K
7340,Edgar Wright simply doesn't miss.
7341,It is indeed
7342,Thank you! I'm so glad to have finally landed on this 4K world!
7343,"Oh, I already have it. I was saddened to find that these were without slipcovers. The first 4K I bought was of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, and it looked so good on the shelf with the slipcover. Uniform and sleek. Additionally, my Blu-ray copy of Michael Mann’s Miami Vice came with a beautiful slipcover with some cool cover art. Slipcovers all the way!"
7344,"Ordered online and arrived via delivery. The stickers have location information and various kinds of codes on them. Granted, I could've just taken the packaging off but I guess I was just too excited haha."
7345,"I can understand. I, too, was expecting a different cover as the one displayed online is different. However, cover art aside, the discs are amazing!"
7346,"I still have quite a few Blu-rays I'd like to get, but for now, I'm happy with what I have. I knew BR2049 would make for a fantastic visual + auditory home experience!"
7347,"Is Baby Driver really a “reference quality” disc? 

I have the standard Blu-ray (bought before I was in the 4K game) and the last time I watched it it looked pretty great. Would you say worth upgrading or just stick with what I have since I already own it."
7348,"Although the Blu-ray is great, in my opinion, the 4K is vastly superior. There's an inexplicable richness to the detail all throughout the film. The HDR is staggering, and the transfer still has the filmic look, which is always a huge plus. It's hard to fault as it looks marvellous all throughout. Not only is it visually brilliant, but audio-wise, it is also quite fantastic."
7349,Honestly never. I wish Last Night in Soho wasn't underrated too. Great film.
7350,"My bestie had a few dinners with him and we were *sure* he was going to cast her in a movie but it just never happened. 

Would’ve been such a delight to see."
7351,"I haven't watched the blu ray, but but imo yeah it's worth upgrading. Helps that its one of my favourite movies but yeah, I think so."

Straight news reporting from beat reporters is generally fact-based and accurate, which earns them a Mixed factual rating.

While EconoTimes says this:
>>Overall, we rate EconoTimes as Least Biased for its neutral reporting focus on financial and economic topics. We also rate it as factually Mixed for factual reporting due to frequent reliance on vague sourcing, lack of external references, and sensationalist framing.

So EconoTimes is considered far more reliable than Fox according to Media Bias Fact Check. And while Fox has numerous failed fact-checks, EconoTimes has none. 

So, yeah. I also don’t know. But judging by this info, the report in EconoTimes about a viral outbreak in China might be accurate."

Hospitals across China are overcrowded as the CCP virus outbreak continues

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, with a large number of children and adults showing symptoms of fever and colds. The official name was “influenza A” and “human metapneumovirus”, but many people said that this wave of so-called “flu” was comparable to the outbreak of the new coronavirus three years ago.

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, and many people say that it is comparable to the COVID-19 outbreak three years ago.

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, with a large number of children and adults showing symptoms of fever and colds . The official name was “influenza A” and “human metapneumovirus”, but many people said that this wave of so-called “flu” was comparable to the outbreak of the new coronavirus three years ago. Videos of crowded children’s hospitals across China have been circulating on social media platforms in recent days, with many children showing symptoms such as fever and cough. A netizen posted a video saying that the “flu” this winter is as powerful as the new coronavirus three years ago . All the hospital beds are occupied. Not only the pediatric department, but also the adult department is overcrowded. Many young and elderly people are infected and have fever.

There are also videos showing that in some hospitals’ pediatric departments, there are still many people queuing up for medical treatment late at night. Some parents even arrive at the hospital in the early morning to queue up for a number, and the infusion room is crowded with people. The Chinese Communist Party’s official media claimed that this wave of infection was caused by the outbreak of “H1N1”. However, many mainland netizens said that the symptoms of H1N1 are exactly the same as those of the new coronavirus. On December 25, the video blogger “Please Fei Ge” said that he and his wife went to Guangzhou to attend an event recently. After returning, they both had a fever, repeated high fevers, body aches, and headaches, just like the feeling of being positive that year. Later, it was learned that all 8 or 9 people who attended the event were infected with “A-type influenza”. In order to avoid infecting their children, he and his wife have been isolated for three days, and they still have a low-grade fever. He reminded everyone: “This feeling is exactly the same as when I got yang back then. It’s very uncomfortable. If you still remember that feeling, wear a mask when you go out in crowded places.” Many netizens on Chinese social platforms have reported that there have been collective infections among people around them. Netizen “色甘酸本色” said on Weibo on December 27: “A professor of infectious diseases at a hospital in a certain country gave a lecture and said that the number of patients in the fever clinic soared from 30 per day to 120 per day within a week. Of course, the good news is that the vast majority of patients who come here are ‘influenza A’. The bad news is that the symptoms of patients are often quite severe. The good news is that patients in the fever clinic generally do not need to be hospitalized. The bad news is that the positive rate of detection in hospitalized critically ill patients is also very high.” “Fang Naoke Deng Boyun” said: “All employees of the community bank have been infected with ‘H1N1’. What happened to the promise that financial industry workers would be the least affected after the opening up? My mother called the branch secretary of her former unit today to inquire about her retirement benefits. The branch secretary is lying at home with a fever. It’s not good to be a ‘lying-down cadre’.”

This pot is not that Hu. I just want to stretch my waist again.” said: “At least four offices in our unit have collectively laid down.” “Pottery Jar” said: “H1N1 is rampant in my workplace.” “The next door prince’s Weibo” said bluntly: “It’s COVID-19 positive.” Li Hongye, chief physician of women and children at Zhumadian Central Hospital, told Elephant News: “The flu has entered an outbreak period. According to the hospital’s epidemiological survey, the number of patients in December increased tenfold compared to November.” On December 27, Kan Biao, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference, “The recent upward trend in the positive detection rate of influenza viruses has been obvious. We have entered the seasonal epidemic period and will continue to rise for some time to come.” He also claimed that the new coronavirus infection is now at a relatively low epidemic level. The China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminds that human metapneumovirus has entered its peak period, and the symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory pathogen infections. There are currently no specific drugs or vaccines . Some netizens bluntly said that this was another outbreak of the “new crown”.

7430,"I appreciate your skepticism and insight. 

I’ve been researching the source, EconoTimes. 

Here’s what I’ve found:

>>These sources have minimal bias and use very few loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by appeals to emotion or stereotypes).  The reporting is factual and usually sourced.  These are the most credible media sources.

>>Overall, we rate EconoTimes as Least Biased for its neutral reporting focus on financial and economic topics. We also rate it as factually Mixed for factual reporting due to frequent reliance on vague sourcing, lack of external references, and sensationalist framing.

>>Detailed Report

Bias Rating: LEAST BIASED (1.8)
Factual Reporting: MIXED (4.8)
Country: South Korea
MBFC’s Country Freedom Rating: MOSTLY FREE
Media Type: Website
Traffic/Popularity: Medium Traffic
MBFC Credibility Rating: MEDIUM CREDIBILITY

>>The consistent lack of external references and sensationalist framing, combined with the use of social media commentary to shape narratives, suggests a focus on engagement over rigorous journalism. 

Failed Fact Checks - **None in the Last 5 years**

>>Overall, we rate EconoTimes as Least Biased for its neutral reporting focus on financial and economic topics. We also rate it as factually Mixed for factual reporting due to frequent reliance on vague sourcing, lack of external references, and sensationalist framing.

https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/econotimes-bias-and-credibility/

So it looks to me that even though the source isn’t the most credible out there, it also hasn’t been found to be factually inaccurate.

Given the other reports that align with this one, I think it’s starting to look more and more likely that something new is starting to spread."
7431,Thank you for letting us know about this. I really appreciate it.
7432,More like December of 2019
7433,"Well, you weren’t wrong. Both are considered “mixed for factual reporting”. But just in different ways. 

We will probably have to wait and see what else develops. 

Maybe the surge in China is like what we saw with Mystery X in the DR Congo. It turned out to be a Covid base with all sorts of co-illnesses piled on from malaria to malnutrition. Covid is like a force-multiplier."

>""We've seen a ton of HMPV,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Most cases are mild, Creech said, involving wheezing and ""lots of snot.""

7581,While receiving immunity from liability and damages. Vaccines are the ideal product for pharmaceutical companies precisely because they have so much societal and media protection (many people are afraid to speak out against them) and actual legal protection.
7582,"I'm an RN working in another state and have been reading your updates for awhile.   About 1-2 weeks after you post your updates we start to see the same things in our clinic.   This week's theme was pink eye, strep and a 'lingering cold.'. Not to much GI stuff yet.  We had a few Covid+ this week. 

As far as staffing goes, our nursing team  is nearly fully staffed if you count out the fact that we have 2 FT positions open and 3 travelers. We were getting incentive for picking up extra shifts but because we're fully staffed they took it away.   When management calls me to pick up extra, my answer is no.   I'd rather work at something non healthcare related if the incentive is gone.  

The money is definitely better in the ED, but not enough to sacrifice my quality of life.  Last I heard it paid around 20%  more. Fortunately my student loans are history or I'd have to reevaluate.  

I hope you can figure out the staffing issues.   Thank you for the updates, I look forward to them."

7586,"Not surprised by the uptick in COVID cases, I figured this was going to be a thing following spring break. Lots of people traveling and hanging out in dense crowds. A friend of mine whose mother works for Disney World says it's one of the busiest weeks of the year."
7587,Thank you for the update. It sounds awful. I appreciate your continued commitment to providing such thorough updates.
7588,"I'm also on the east coast and have similar symptoms and my partner as well as my boss and her child. We are healthy adults, fit, eat well, etc. And I got sick on Wednesday of last week, chills, sore through, burning feeling in nose but negative covud test, negative test for him too and I still have an unusual cough after a week, so does he, that hasn't gone away. Not to be graphic but still producing a lot of mucus thats yellow, like way more then any other time ive been sick. We rarely get sick. I never catch colds or the flu so it is  unusual.   I don't know if posting this helps anything but I see people getting sick around me too."
7589,I just read that the newest XBB1.6 is dominant - it’s very similar to the last XBB. Mix that up with spring break and we’ll have a tick upwards.
7590,"Yup, you called what's being seen statewide. Most counties this week had a 200-300% increase in cases."
7591,Thank you so much for keeping us informed.
7592,Pay your nurses more than they would make at a hospital and you’ll find they will come to you in droves.
7593,">  I'm not sure of the reason for this - pay? Hours? Patient volume? New database learning curve? 

I don't know the answer. But as a generality in life I find ""all of these contribute"" is a good default answer."

7603,"It's crazy that I'm even sick before covid begain, I was one of those people you could never wash hands, be around anybody sick, etc. For my whole life. Now I catch every little thing and we are still coughing up the yellow stuff today. I'm going to start use a nasal spray with zylitole and grapefruit extract and see if that helps. I'll repost if it helps."
7604,Oh no- absolutely…. I’ve just had terrible luck w that one. Glad it helped you! That sounds awful.
7605,Another person I know is getting sick. A friend of mine is on the way to urgent care today with the same symptoms.

Translation: Monitoring data showed that the positive rate of influenza virus testing in southern and northern provinces continued to rise this week. The A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype was the main one. A total of 171 influenza-like cases were reported nationwide.

From April 1 , 2024 to December 29 , 2024 ( based on experimental date statistics), 1844 strains ( 97.0% ) of A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype influenza virus were similar to A/Victoria/4897/2022 ; 392 strains ( 56.0 % ) of A(H3N2) subtype influenza virus were similar to A/Thailand/8/2022 (chicken embryo strain); 453 strains ( 64.7% ) were similar to A/Thailand/8/2022 (cell strain) ; 997 strains ( 99.1% ) of B(Victoria) were similar to B / Austria /1359417/2021 ."

7711,"Đây có lẽ là con bài chính trị của Trung Quốc đã rất thành công với COVID-19. Khi đảng cầm quyền đang chịu áp lực lớn và họ không thể gây ra 1 cuộc chiến tranh để dân họ xả giận, thì dịch bệnh có lẽ là con bài của họ. Luận điệu có lẽ là “ Chúng ta cần đoàn kết lại, mọi khó khăn là do con virus này. Đảng sẽ đưa chúng ta thoát khỏi nó”…….. Nên nhớ Cộng Sản không no sống chết của người dân. Thứ họ quan tâm là làm sao để kiểm soát dc dân chúng. Một vị lãnh đạo đầy đức độ Trung Q từng nói” Tôi có 1 tỉ dân nếu chết 1 nửa tôi vẫn còn 500triệu dân”"
7712,"Vừa mới tham khảo báo BBC và New York Times.

Thì con virus này nó nguy hiểm hơn cảm cúm bình thường, nhưng không nguy hiểm như sars covid 19 hay các loại virus cúm khác. Ở các quốc gia lạnh như tàu khựa, đông đúc, chen chúc, thì bệnh nó dễ lây lan hơn, với lại, tàu khựa nó không có nền y tế tốt như châu âu hay mỹ, và hệ miễn dịch của dân tàu khựa nó rất yếu, nên bị quá tải bệnh viện là chuyện đương nhiên. 

Trước hết thì không nên hoảng sợ, lo lắng một đại dịch như là Covid 19. Vì đây là một loại virus rất phổ biến, có từ rất lâu và đã được phát hiện từ tận hồi 2001. Nó sống chung với loài người mấy thập kỷ rồi, các triệu chứng thì vẫn giống như cảm, ảnh hưởng nhiều nhất là hệ hô hấp. 

Nhưng. Nếu bạn đang sống ở việt nam, một nơi có khí hậu, chất lượng không khí tồi tệ, môi trường sống bẩn thỉu. Và bạn nghĩ rằng bạn có một hệ miễn dịch kém. Thì bạn nên đeo khẩu trang, tránh nơi đông người nếu có thể, thường xuyên rửa tay bằng sản phẩm sát khuẩn. Đi khám khi có các triệu chứng (triệu chứng thế nào thì chịu khó lên mạng tham khảo). 

Có thể là do hậu covid, chích mấy cái vaccine của tàu khựa nên dân tàu mới yếu như vậy. Mà mấy cái vaccine khác của anh hay đức, dạo gần đây bị bóc phốt là làm giảm sức đề kháng, tăng nguy cơ bị các chứng bệnh khác.

Không có gì là chắc chắn, nên phải cẩn thận, nhưng tuyệt đối không làm cho bản thân và người khác hoang mang."

I'm not from India and based on a check about these news sources, they are noted as right-center biased.

7799,"Yes, our ped told us about this already. Hopefully it won't be before mine are finished."
7800,"Have 3 kids.  11, 8 and 3.

The 11 year old has most shots.  The 8 also has most but is some more at 10 years old.

The 3 year old is all up to date for age so that's most of them....  I just don't think I'll bother with anymore going forward.

I just don't trust anymore.

I'll maybe look at them individually and assess risks.

I got my kids measles and chickenpox vaccines which were optional here and cost like 300$ after a friend's kid got chicken pox and swole up like a balloon and ended up in hospital for 3 weeks and almost died.

Those vaccines do appear to work and the data on them is pretty good.  But this covid shit has just got me questioning all of them and not getting vaccinated opens them up to a small risk potentially larger risk as an adult.

Bother options are not great but I think no vax might be the less risky option at this point... Fuck does that make me an anti vaxxers?"

7805,"I'm an African. I have less than a quarter of the vaxxes on the US schedule. My youngest sibling is 100% unvaxxed. I never even got the tetanus and MMR shots. I've never even heard anyone - in my 31 years of life - who's contracted these diseases, yet alone died from them. I've been a super-antivaxxer since I was 18."
7806,"Well outbreaks of measles and chickenpox are super rare here in New Zealand and I do actually think these are pretty good vaccines traditionally.

But seeing my friends 2 year old on life support swollen likea balloon after catching chicken pox was incredibly scary.

It can affect some children very severely.

She was too young to get the optional vaccine and you had to pay for it.  Now it's free."
7807,How about wearing a mask? Oh wait that would not be fun. Better get sick.
7808,"Not new.

It was first isolated in 2001 but scientists have  extrapolated from the DNA that it may have moved from animal (avian) to humans sometime in the early 1800s. There are still avian-only strains. 

It is found all over the world. Most people are thought to be exposed by the age of five, but you do not gain immunity from exposure.

It's normally a mild virus and often confused with its cousin RSV or other respiratory viruses. HPMV and RSV are virtually identical in symptoms, vulnerable populations and season, which it also shares with influenza and all the other usual winter respiratory viruses.

Normally it only gives you several days of cold  symptoms. But in young infants, elderly, and the immunocompromised, it can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia, which is how it becomes deadly.

There is no vaccine yet for HMPV. The only treatment is symptom alleviation and generic antivirals.

Normally this wouldn't be a huge concern but the avian flu after the years of Covid hell naturally has everyone paranoid right now."
7809,"""
I rewrote the headline for you. ""People sick with usual winter virus.""
This article is nothing but click bait. It's a big fat nothing burger. It's the equivalent of saying ""sunburns on the rise this July as kids go to the pool."" HMPV happens every year just like RSV and Flu and there is nothing here that indicates it's a mutated strain or any concern."
7810,Why do these things always seem to originate in China?
7811,"I hate the fact that COVID has traumatized us to the point where we literally take any virus surging as a sign of a pandemic…

I wish that the world had acted earlier on COVID so we wouldn’t be dealing with this now."

7813,Huh I need that training for my immune system?? /s
7814,"The title is one of the better ones considering all the other articles out there calling it a mystery virus. I interpreted it as a ""new virus surge"" or ""outbreak."" In any case, I agree with you 100% that the reporting of this seems to be creating a great deal of panic over a cold-like virus."
7815,"Oh man, there's so many reasons. High population, high density, rich biodiversity, live animal markets, poaching wild animals for traditional Chinese medicine products. I'm sure rapid urbanization and climate change probably play a role too. Similar reasoning applies to Africa. 

I do wonder if it is ""always China"" because China is so interconnected. If it's in China, then there's no containing it."
7816,Because they have like 1/5th of the entire global population and are the 3rd or 4th largest country by size as well.
7817,"Yep, 10 infections at minimum for that so called herd immunity"
7818,China has a robust infectious disease response apparatus as well. When novel viruses emerge elsewhere they can take much longer to both spread and be properly identified. Look at that respiratory illness + malaria cluster in DRC that terrified everyone for a while because it was so remote they couldn't do accurate tests.

China is well known for hiding things like this without a care for human lives. 

Doctors in Wuhan were trying to raise alarm since at least December 2019 and the Chinese govt silenced them. For all we know, they are probably doing the same thing now, and simply passing off a new virus as HMPV. Or it's HMPV with new mutations. Could be so many scenarios, I won't trust a word that comes out of China's mouth."

8087,"I always really appreciate your updates but I think you may have gotten a few things wrong here

>So...if you're a senior who has had both the Flu and Pneumonia vaccines, you shouldn't be fearing for your life. You're probably going to be okay. 

I’m not sure if you’re trying to say that the pneumococcal (“pneumonia”) vaccines will protect against HMPV pneumonia—it won’t. That vaccine protects against a specific bacterial cause of pneumonia that often occurs secondarily to viral infections but, unfortunately, it doesn’t help with viral infections themselves. 

We also don’t know how effective the flu shot is this season. It’s too early in the Northern Hemisphere season to have usable data but, [per CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7339a1.htm), in the Southern Hemisphere VE was around 35%. Not the greatest even by flu vaccine standards but it’s still always better to get vaccinated than to skip it.

>Kids on the other hand…there is no Pneumonia vaccine for them

Kids under 5 are supposed to get full series of the Hib and pneumococcal vaccines both of which protect against bacteria which are common causes of pneumonia (along with meningitis and sepsis). Again, though, neither of these will protect against pneumonia caused by HMPV"
8088,"This amazes me! Why are we not informed about this child pneumonia vaccine in FL? I know it's pretty uniform, so I'm guessing it's our lovely Ladapo, crushing vaccine info as usual. 

Here is the schedule for children under 6 yrs:

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/child-easyread.html

Hasn't vaccination become amazing!? The thing about this is that kids need to see their pediatrician often, and the kids I saw (and their parents) were entirely unaware of the vaccines their kids (under 6) had gotten. Since my Urgent Care no longer had a clinical member that was registered to update vaccine records, we stopped accepting vaccine record cards for kids getting school physicals. 

The fact that kids (hopefully) have been armed with lots of antibodies against Flu and bacterial pneumonia also cheers me - but parents need to be very wary. With kids in daycare it's going to be rough, and parents need to be responsible about spreading illnesses within their toddler's circles.   

You're right. Having a flu shot and pneumonia shot is the same as getting a Covid shot: they are not wholly preventative. Viral pneumonia is a tricky customer. 

But having these shots and *mask wearing* really *does* cut the infection rate, no matter which way you look at it. *Not* getting the Flu (or having a milder infection, teamed up with Tamivir) will spare most seniors from bacterial pneumonia, community spread pneumonia, walking pneumonia, and viral pneumonias like HMPV. 

(Just remember seniors: Going on those care-free maskless cruises will virtually *guarantee* that you come home with *something*.)

You should know that the readers of this subreddit are staunchly aware that mask wearing and proper hand hygiene are the two big tools in our arsenal against catching the viruses that plague us. 

We tend to work in tandem with the r/zerocovidcommunity to keep people aware, and help those with few options protect themselves. 

Very happy to have you here to help. We have very few Pediatricians in this sub, and as you can tell, I am distinctly behind the times. I need to do more research in future posts.

Do give us your input more often!"

Featured topic and speakers

Should I be worried about bird flu? How dangerous is the new COVID variant? How does bird flu spread to humans? Is bird flu going to become a pandemic? What is HMPV?

AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia, JD, MPH, discusses the ""mystery virus"" human metapneumovirus, that HMPV is not new, and shares trends in seasonal influenza and COVID-19 cases. Also covering the latest bird flu news of H5N9 on a California duck farm, as well as a raw pet food recall and the dangers of H5N1 for dogs and cats. AMA Chief Experience Officer Todd Unger hosts."
8129,"Danky, I’ve seen you comment enough on here to ask: worth the watch? I tend to stick to twiv and articles/papers so I don’t oversaturate myself on this topic"
8130,"Hi, thanks for the kind words. It sounds like you’ve either seen more of or put more stock in my thoughtful comments than my ones during meltdown (lol I’m autistic). Anyway, I appreciate and am honestly a little flattered by your interest in my opinion, haha.

So I didn’t bother watching it before commenting lol. I was more commenting conceptually based on the title but at 5 minutes in I’d say it’s worth a watch. They start off discussing Guardian and NY Times articles which we’re familiar here but around 4 minutes in they mention that a cattle heard was infected in spring and then showed mild symptoms in like November and just kind of brush over the idea that this could have been from infections that weren’t cleared (I’ve had Long Covid since Feb 2020 so that scared me), and they seem to focus their concern on reinfections.

I’m nearing the end now and they put a rather strong and detailed emphasis on the caveats of the “low risk” assessment closer to 2/3 through. I’ll go finish the video but I’d say yes, worth a watch if you’ve got 15 min but it’s not critical."
8131,Great. I appreciate the summary. It’s getting to the point where we can probably half the articles we read so I didn’t want to lose twenty or thirty minutes of my life 😝

8221,"It’s a non-story outside of Asia because it was thought to largely be contained to a specific region, until about a month ago when the strain mutated and became more infectious. It’s a game of chance as to when that happens, as nature rolls the dice randomly until a mutation surfaces and the virus either gets neutered or more deadly. 

There have really only been minor blurbs on network TV so far from what I’ve seen, it’s not a huge concern but potentially could be under certain circumstances.

IMO, H5N1 is the bigger threat. Not only will you have 1M+ bird culls regularly, but it can infect your dogs and cats and spread to you, and vice versa. It hasn’t developed the ability to jump human to human yet, and there haven’t been cases confirmed outside of people who work directly with sick birds. It’s a when, not an if, it jumps human to human- the question will be how sturdy it is against treatment when it happens.

However- a sample taken from a Louisiana patient last month showed that his strain of H5N1 had a mutation that allowed it to more efficiently bind to human receptors. You can’t predict when this happens, it just does."

""Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a **common respiratory virus** that causes an upper respiratory infection (like a [cold](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/influenza/facts-about-the-common-cold)). **It is a seasonal disease** that usually occurs in the winter and early spring, similar to [RSV](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/rsv) and the [flu](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/influenza).""

8246,"Don't forget about H1N1, still circulating among the pig population in the Mainland."
8247,"Honestly, COVID was awful- but for America in particular it was a self made problem. There were reports of a potential virus being covered up in Wuhan by January (at least that was the earliest I had seen any articles talking about it). Finding the specific article I read would be looking for a needle in a haystack, even back then media shoved doom and gloom down our throats. After multiple years of people talking incessantly about the topic finding the specific one and proving it was before COVID really took off is more of a headache than it is worth. The point is, It was global news it had become a pandemic LONG before it could have reasonably infected too many people in the U.S.

The fact that people refused to wear masks was them being stupid and belligerent. It's like refusing to wash your hands after touching raw meat, just because there was a sign telling you it's required to stay safe. That's not even getting into some people's antagonism towards the CDC, outright suggesting bleach as a treatment, and anti-vaxx conspiracies."
8248,"It's not a novel virus like COVID was. It's been around for decades. Most adults have already been exposed. Severe illness is more likely the first time someone is infected. Subsequent infections are usually pretty mild.

It's being recognized in China primarily because they can now discern it from a cold, and particularly from RSV which it is most closely related to. Most of those needing medical intervention are children who are being infected for the first time."

8250,"Yeah hmpv is not new and exactly this. 

However, H5N1, and the largest chicken and duck population in the world…. And not that many reports on it…… i’m  surprised. "

It won't be rare if the Wuhan Institute of Virology is the one working to that end though.

We should be more worried about a new human-human H1N1 strain."

8333,Δεν μπορώ να ακούω ότι ένας ιός είναι ήπιος όταν πολύς κόσμος (συμπεριλαμβανομένου και εμου) έχουμε post covid syndromes.
8334,ακριβως για να αποφυγω αυτο ειναι η μοναδικη λεξη που εβαλα τονο! axaxax
8335,"Κατά πρώτον, τον covid τον έμπλεξες μόνος/η σου στη συζήτηση, εγώ δεν συνέκρινα αυτόν τον ιό με τον covid στο αρχικό μου σχόλιο. Δεύτερον, νομίζω \*κατέληξε\* (χρησιμοποιώ πολύ συγκεκριμένο λεξιλόγιο) ενδημικός και στον περισσότερο κόσμο εκδηλώνεται ήπια πλέον εξ ου και ήρθη το καθεστώς πανδημίας. Υπάρχουν διακυμάνσεις ως προς το τι προκαλεί ακριβώς που εξαρτώνται από πολλούς και διάφορους παράγοντες οι οποίοι είναι λίγο-πολύ γνωστοί. Και αν παίρνεις ως παράδειγμα εσένα και τον ""πολύ κόσμο"" μπορώ και εγώ να σου φέρω ως παράδειγμα εμένα και ""πολύ κόσμο"" ακόμα που κολλήσαν κόβιντ ένα σωρό φορές και δεν έπαθαν τίποτα το σοβαρό. Λυπάμαι για το ότι σου άφησε post covid syndromes και εύχομαι να τα ξεπεράσεις σύντομα!"
8336,"Λυπάμαι για αυτό, αλλά σχεδόν όλοι έχουμε περάσει COVID πολλάκις, άλλοι πιο βαριά άλλοι πιο ελαφριά, και σε ελάχιστους αφήνει πραγματικά κουσούρια. Οπότε ήπιος θεωρείται πλέον."
8337,"Ξέρεις τι, το άτομο στο οποίο απάντησες δεν είναι αυτό που ""έμπλεξε"" τον covid στη συζήτηση αρχικά. Είναι μια συχνή παρανόηση, αλλά ενδημικός δε σημαίνει ήπιος. Έχει να κάνει με την ταχύτητα εμφάνισης νέων κρουσμάτων. Μπορείς να βρεις ωραίες εξηγήσεις για τους όρους ενδημικός - επιδημία - πανδημία, αξίζει να το γκουγκλάρεις. Σκέψου για παράδειγμα τον hiv, δεν ακούμε για πανδημία πλέον, αλλά παραμένει επικίνδυνος ιός και πάντα υπάρχουν νέα κρούσματα. 

Τώρα για τον covid, ευτυχώς πολλοί τον περνάμε ήπια. Αλλά και εδώ υπάρχει μια αβεβαιότητα επειδή οι περισσότεροι κρίνουν με βάση τα συμπτώματα του αναπνευστικού. Αρκετοί, και νέοι ανάμεσα τους, έχουν εμφανίσει προβλήματα σε άλλα οργανικά συστήματα και δεν τους περνάει από το μυαλό ότι ίσως είναι από covid, ο οποίος έχει τη δυνατότητα να τα προκαλέσει.

8339,"Family's had it recently - gave a toddler pneumonia and put them in hospital. However, the older relos had mostly cold symptoms and a lingering chesty cough. Could stick around for 2 weeks still, is what they were told. I thought I had hayfever, but it's possible I also had this virus, but I've been fine after only a couple days on the claratyne, but I also never had a problem recovering from Covid either. I can't really add much, but yours sounds much rougher than I'd seen."
8340,"Often what happens with viruses is that when your body is more weakened by the virus it’s fighting (in this case hmpv), a second virus or even a bacteria can superimpose a second infection over the top. Given that you got better first, I suspect you may have picked up a second infection when you first went to the hospital. You probably had a week of feeling better as you recovered from the hmpv while the second infection incubated, and then you subsequently got sicker. 
The fact that you are still feeling ill probably means you are suffering from the lasting inflammation in your lungs from the pneumonia (takes 4-6 weeks post pneumonia to completely resolve) but if you’re still feeling crap consider heading back to your Gp for a progress chest X-ray and /or viral swab"
8341,"My mother (70ish) had it about 6 weeks ago. She didn’t go to hospital, but only because she’s a stubborn woman, because she should have. First few days it started as a bit of a cough, then came the stuffy nose/sore throat/cold type symptoms. The cough just kept getting worse, she couldn’t sleep, said her chest was bubbling and rattling, that she’s never had a cough like that before. At one point her blood oxygen levels dropped to 92, but she didn’t tell me that until the next day else I would have called an ambulance. She was coughing until she was sick for about 2 weeks, and all up was very, very unwell for 4 weeks. She’s slowly getting energy back now."
8342,"Yep. I had this for about four weeks and was sick as the proverbial dog. Uncontrollable coughing to the point where I was convinced I had whooping cough, wheezing and 'bubbling' breathing. Not fun. It's viral so there's nothing that can really be done except to rest. I hope you feel better soon."
8343,"I have a vague recollection this is what wrecked my brother and SIL for like four weeks. She has an autoimmune condition (not AS tho), so got all the follow-up testing to find out what it was (especially as this was closer to the pandemic times) and it's not surprising it messed her up, but he was also miserable for a long period of time. I guess it can hit people differently."
8344,"It's been a few years, but a relative had HMPV , and was sick for about 5 weeks. But like yourself, it took probably too long to be diagnosed. If it had been caught earlier, her outcome may have been shorter.


As for her health regime,  she swore by honey, lemon and eucalyptus in a bowl with steaming water and teatowel over the head? Not sure it was medical or mind, but she believed it helped her breathing. Plus antibiotics, vitamin c and d and sitting in the sun? Who knows which o f those was the fix(I'd say the antibiotics, but I wouldn't tell her that) but I think at least in her mind, they all helped. At least, none of them were harmful.


Good luck, and hopefully good health."
8345,"I reckon there’s a nasty version around at the moment. I never had it before (that I’m aware of) it laid me and my husband up for five or six weeks. My husband in particular is very fit. I also had a number of colleagues with it. Similar situation.  

The most frustrating part was the ebb and flow for me. I’d think I was over it and the next day feel like death again."
8346,[deleted]
8347,"Hello. I’ve just recovered from this (still have a cough though). Was the worst 2 weeks of my life. I couldn’t eat. If I did eat I’d vomit it up because of the violent coughing. I couldn’t sleep. If I did fall asleep, I’d be abruptly woken up by a cough. I couldn’t do anything for 2 weeks. I was bed bound. 

I’m generally quite healthy and get over bugs quite easily. This was different. My kids both had it (I suspect I got it from my youngest from daycare) they both had nothing but a mild cough. My husband didn’t get it at all. 

I hope it’s near the end of the illness for you - I’ve read it can be up to 4 weeks recovery time. 

What helped me the most was lots of fluids. Hydrolite icypoles were a godsend. Rikodeine cough medicine helped with the cough at night so I could sleep - apparently it can be addictive though."
8348,"I had it, my son had it, my husband had it. Hands down the worst virus ever. Covid is nothing compared to it. I was out for a week. My son was 2 at the time and was in hospital for a week just sleeping. He developed a secondary infection and then had to start antibiotics."
8349,"I had it last month and it lasted a couple of weeks for me. My asthma got so bad so I went to hospital but there wasn’t much they could about it beside control the asthma attack. 
The guy next to me was 84yo and had a nurse guard him at all times. I was there for five days, he had a long way to go before being discharged."
8350,Been crook as a dog for 3 weeks cough has cleared up but ears still blocked and still having dizzy spells.
8351,.
8352,"Perhaps you had a superimposed pneumonia on top, since you were given IV antibiotics at the hospital. This would take longer to recover from. I understand you feel like death, but really recommend you get up and do deep breathing exercises, gentle bed exercises and walking etc. to help with chest clearance and reduce deconditioning.

Human metapneumovirus isn't part of the usual rapid respiratory viral swab, but is on the full panel. I have seen a few patients seriously unwell with it (requiring ICU or non-invasive ventilation), but all elderly or with significant respiratory comorbidities."
8353,I had it last year. It’s the sickest I’ve ever been. I struggled at home with pneumonia for nearly a week unable to lie down or sleep. When I finally admitted myself to hospital I was diagnosed with pneumonia and dangerously low sodium. They corrected the sodium and ordered some chest physio. I found the Triflow and Bubble PEP helped enormously in recovering from the pneumonia but it took about a week. My boss and a friend both in their sixties but very fit also got pneumonia from the same virus.
8354,"Human metapneumovirus, and many others aren't on the rapid Flu, Covid RSV PCR that we usually run on presentations to hospital like yours. Assuming they did swab you, I'd suspect that is why they didn't find the exact virus you had. But it sounds like they felt you had a viral infection hence the next comment. Sounds like you've then picked up a secondary bacterial pneumonia after a respiratory viral infection, which can happen. Earlier antibiotics wouldn't have been justified.

I had it recently but joyfully combined with Influenza A at the same time. Fortunately the strain of FluA we've been seeing has been milder than is typical. But I was pretty off, with high fevers for about 4 days and took me about a week to come good. I didn't pick up a secondary infection fortunately.


Hope you feel better soon."
8355,"Currently in bed resting hoping to get rid of it. Been 2 weeks now. Went to the docs day 5 because I was coughing up blood. They did a swab, got me on antibiotics thinking it was bronchitis or pneumonia. I'm so over being sick. The googling i did said 5-8 days. Yeah right. Started using a nasal douche to clean everything out and now I've got ears that keep popping when I blow my nose and feel like they've been perforated. No longer coughing up blood though. "
8356,[deleted]
8357,"Yeah all the best for you mate, get well soon."
8358,"I’ve been suffering for at least 3 weeks now with symptoms like what you’ve described, and no amount of Panadol, cough syrup or lozenges have helped. I’ve only felt marginally better since yesterday morning so here’s hoping."
8359,bro had visions
8360,Bruh lol
8361,And nice you got that immunity boost from whatever is coming
8362,"Had a couple of weeks back and it was pretty mild.

Sorish throat and a bit of a cough.

Biggest thing I found was fatigued and it was really hard to focus, my memory is shot from that week.

Regarding recovery, got it over the long weekend, took Wednesday and Thursday off, started feeling better so went to work Friday.

Was fine until 3pm and started feeling crap, even more so than Wednesday/Thursday.

Rest of the weekend was spent sleeping and playing video games. 

Then I got gastro once the hMPV cleared up..."
8363,"Yes, I’ve heard of it. It seems to have increased in prevalence post Covid."
8364,Sounds like you had a viral infection and got bacterial pneumonia as a result of that? Not sure if that means there was something special about that virus.
8365,"I had it around 4 weeks ago, i was super sick for about 3 weeks. Didn’t work or study for 2 weeks because of a nasty cough and the worst fever i’ve ever had.

The fever lasted 5 days and at one point reached 41.5, my HR never went below 140 for 3 days.

I went to hospital for it where my hr reached 170 and had the whole workup for pneumonia, sepsis, etc.
I stayed in hospital for 2 nights and had 6L of fluids via IV and some meds for my fever.

My hr is still not back to normal yet and am seeing a cardiologist next week for it."
8366,"I had the pleasure of getting this and rhinoviris at the same time. Was basically bed bound for 3 days, took 6 total days off work and worked from home for another 5. Pretty much 2 solid weeks of very very bad cold symptoms."
8367,"It’s not the virus that’s affecting you now, it’s the secondary bacterial infection.

In 2022, my GP swabbed us and came back hMPV and he’s said, “like a version of the common cold”. A week later, the infectious diseases physician I saw said, “yes, for some people, but I’ve also had professional athletes in hospital with it.” 

I ended up in hospital with pneumonia (and ICU with an anaphylactic response to iv antibiotics, but that’s another story). 

My 3 yo had it first and he was the sickest he’s ever been (but treatable at home). 

I turned up to the GP with my 6 month old who had croup from hMPV and he asked if I was sick too. I shrugged, he took my temperature and listened to my chest and told me to go straight to the hospital. 

Are you still taking antibiotics? Pneumonia is awful, and particularly if you’ve had it before, any of these respiratory viruses can tip into a chest infection. 

I’m also asthmatic and had a small baby at the time, and was on the antibiotics (new ones I wasn’t allergic to) for a few weeks and prednisolone to give my lungs a boost."
8368,"This virus is running through my family right now. We all had rsv earlier in the year / COVID mid year and Hmpv definetly feels harsher than COVID respiratory wise but on par with rsv. However, we are all getting random aches with this hmpv virus ( my heads pounding, Mrs getting hives and chest pain. This virus is dragging longer than the other viruses we've copped. My 3 year old is a week in and still hasn't had a good night's rest as he keeps waking up in pain or fever but cuddles and pain relief fixes it. On the other hand my infant is finding it harder to manage :("
8369,"I have this at the moment in the USA. I'm from Oklahoma. My 4 year old daughter had to be hospitalized for 2 days because of it. She is doing better. My 8 year old daughter also came down with it but she didn't have to be hospitalized. I am currently the only one sick. The wife seems to have lucked out, as she is still showing no symptoms. I'm mostly doing okay except for the sore throat. Literally feels like strep at times. I pray it doesn't work it's way down to my lungs. I have a bad history with bronchitis and pneumonia."
8370,How are you now? Currently going through this virus
8371,Is it same virus which is spreading in china
8372,"About to all get it shortly it may seem 👏😭😅
Line up once more"
8373,"Yeah my GP said the case of Pneumonia didn’t help my recovery process and that’s why I’ve taken so much longer to get better. It’s not great, I’m usually a healthy person and I jump back from infections quite quickly so this has been a completely new experience for me"
8374,"You’re absolutely right by the way, word for word what my GP said. He said most people get better without complications but I picked up another bacterial infection in the lungs (the pneumonia) and still subsequently recovering. It was diagnosed with an X-ray a week ago but I saw him just a few days ago and he says I’m recovering the and secondary infection has subsided a great amount just by listening with his stethoscope."
8375,"Thank god your mother is doing better. I hear this virus in particular can be quite detrimental for older people over the age of 65+, I can only imagine how much worse it was for her. On the other hand, I’m 31 and I’ve been through the trenches so I hope she recovers <3"
8376,"That’s exactly how it feels, every 15 seconds or so I get a feeling or blockage if you will that I need to cough up through the night. The bubbling feeling is not fun and still suffering from it as we speak. After about week 4, did you feel yourself improve?"
8377,"Especially with an autoimmune condition, I hope your sister in law is healthy now? I had nothing like an autoimmune condition so she must have gone through much worse. Yeah it’s actually been making the rounds in Australia at an increasing rate because we were so Covid aware (mask wearing, sanitising) but now we’ve let our guard down, other viruses are popping up."
8378,">If it had been caught earlier, her outcome may have been shorter.


There is no treatment but supportive care. How would an earlier diagnosis have changed their management?"
8379,"Thank you that makes me feel so much better to know it was just as long of a health recovery. That’s all I really wanted, was some sort of validation that I wasn’t an outlier. I will try the honey, lemon and eucalyptus and increase my intake of vitamin D tablets (as I also have not been taking them recently because of how sick I’ve been), this might also be a huge contributing factor, thank you for all your advice Lastbalmain. It was the real helpful one for me"
8380,Okay so 5-6 weeks is what I’m reading from everybody which goes against what my GP has been telling me. He has been saying I should have recovered by now.. but the plethora of comments tell me otherwise. Which is exactly what I wanted by posting this
8381,"I also have this horrid virus and can resonate with the ebb and flow. May I ask, how long was your acute phase?"
8382,"Ebb and flow? Sorry what did you mean? Yeah apparently the first infection is the nastiest as there is no immunological defence from the body. I’m not sure whether it’s the virus that’s particularly nasty, or my immunodeficiency from diet, health etc. Either way, Covid was heaven compared to this."
8383,"Trying my best to do this, thank you for the kind comment. I’ve been trying to distract myself with Netflix but the progression has been slow and frustrating… in my mind, I’ve gotten to the point where I feel, according to my other google searches, that I should be better. I think you’re right in that that may be where the problem resides."
8384,"Way to go in being dismissive. People like you don’t help. 

OP is going through something new and unknown and worrying. It’s natural and comforting to seek out others. That’s why most health issues have peer support groups."
8385,"Terrible advice for someone going through a virus that is extremely difficult to treat. 


Your suggestion is basically ""suck it up, and take it easy""? "
8386,"Hey,  You won’t believe it but I’ve got Rikodiene cough syrup on my desk as we speak. It doesn’t help much and I initially bought the one for the chesty cough but now is more of a hacking cough which apparently is a good thing cause it means it’s no longer in the lungs. Yes I am exactly the same, I usually bounce back from most guys but this was another kind of death warmed up. Never in my life had I felt like this. Like I was dying. Thank you for sharing your experience, the more I read from other people, the better I feel. Thank you and hope you are healthy now too."
8387,"Thank you for letting me know - that’s all I needed was the validation. It’s unlike any virus I’ve ever had in my life. Hands down, Covid was a walk in the park compared to it. I hope you, your husband and your son is healthy and happy now. It really means a lot to hear your experience because it makes me feel a lot better about taking so long to recover. <3"
8388,"Poor guy - I always feel bad for the older ones. They deserve all the attention and love we can give them because they have so much to give us back. Lucky nothing bad happened with you because you also have asthma, from all the comments I’ve read, there is always a underlying predisposition that makes it worse. I have a feeling it’s the same for me. I hope you’re healthy now and feeling better"
8389,"Been diagnosed with HMPV with a blood test? How are you doing now, getting better?"
8390,Do you work in the health sector? You sound like you have experience caring for patients. A nurse? Yes it was a super imposed pneumonia on top that made me worse from an X-ray done last week. Severe congestion was detected and wheezing was quite bad. The good news is this week the pneumonia has cleared up and mostly just a hacking cough now
8391,"How old are you if you don’t mind me asking? I’m in my early 30s, are you around the same age? I only ask because my pneumonia has mostly cleared up but still very sick going on week 3 so I’d like to compare with your experience."
8392,"And yes, I did pick up a secondary infection. That was confirmed with an X-ray last week! Then you for your well wishes. It’s deeply appreciated."
8393,"I suspect that was the case, they did try to get to the bottom of how I was feeling. Took a urine and stool sample for testing because they suspected a gastrointestinal infection. Unfortunately though, hospitals will do the bare minimum to make sure you’re not in a state of emergency care and send you on your way if you are healthy enough… which is exactly what happened with me."
8394,As I read my comment I realised how morbid it must be in its own right. But having company through a difficult time is better than facing the illness alone.
8395,"That’s good that blood is no longer being coughed up! Also reading your post made me feel a little better because as I was reading, I related more and more. The fact you are also suffering from it at this moment is something I needed to hear. All the googling says 6-12 days. It’s complete bullshit. Keep your chin up! You will get through it xo"
8396,So how many weeks in total do you think it took before you could consider you were of normal function? I hope all your family is happy and healthy as of now🙏
8397,Sounds like you fought like a pro though and didn’t have too much trouble bouncing back - including any family members.
8398,Thank you for the well wishes 🙏
8399,"Here’s hoping for you too 🤞 most people bounce back relatively quickly but some do not, I have gotten feelings of malaise worsen since yesterday but from what I’ve read, it comes in stages. Hoping this is not the case for you and you come out of this soon!! I hope my post helped to some degree. Btw, cough syrup does nothing for me too lol"
8400,"Seems I’m psychic, get ready for it cause it’s fucking terrible"
8401,"Sounds like your case was way more mild than mine, which is a good thing. I think you’re what a “normal” person goes through with this virus, sounds like it didn’t hit very hard for you. If only we were all the same!"
8402,"
heavy agree about the focus and memory, especially on top of my adhd. i’m in the early stages of this infection but i’m going poorly. the big problem is that i’m in the middle of finals (i’ve had to cancel 2/4 of my exams) and have tried so hard to do the last little parts of an essay but just cannot focus at all even with meds. hmpv has some scary long covid vibes but hopefully it’ll pass"
8403,"Yeah apparently since we’ve been so Covid prevalent with masks and sanitising, our guards are down and now all of these existing viruses are running rampant"
8404,Yeah I did receive a secondary infection - but doctor has said it's mostly cleared up since last week when I got the drip + the box of antibiotics. X-ray has returned normal now but still feeling quite unwell.
8405,"Ooof HR of 170 and a fever of 41.5.. Sounds very rough.  Doesn't sound good. I've had the same pleasures of having a high heart rate in the last few months due to an anxiety condition but of course, yours is due to to the viral infection. Do you still feel unwell or is it just the heart rate that's the issue now?"
8406,"Yeah, at the brink of my infection, my fever was quite high (around 39) but it wasn't in your range. Lucky now my fever has subsided and pneumonia has cleared up but feelings of malaise still prevalent."
8407,"Sounds like you bounced back relatively quickly, even with TWO viruses at the same time, Jesus - yeah mine didn't feel like really bad cold symptoms but basically like I was on the brink of death at one point. The good news is that NOW it feels like very very bad cold symptoms but still not like any cold I've ever had before. That's great news on your part though. Happy you're doing well now though, did you feel yourself bounce back relatively quickly after the two week mark?"
8408,"Yeah my dad has said the same thing unfortunately, that the virus is no longer the issue but I have a sneaking suspicion it is both the pneumonia from last week and the virus taking it's toll still. Yeah, I was given a round at the hospital of antibiotics and given a box to finish last week. I knew I had to finish the whole box otherwise the pneumonia would grow back. Have been examined now with a new X-ray and stethoscope exam from the doc, all cleared up and lung infection largely gone. Just feelings of malaise , fatigue and unwellness in general now that are still prevalent .

P.S. I wish my doctor was as self comforting as yours, because mine was dismissive and said I should have been better by now... sounds like it's time to switch lol."
8409,Hope your 3 y.o is doing better and well wishes on all of you!!! <33
8410,"Oh Jesus I hope you guys are alright, yeah I’m on week 4 now and still feeling quite lethargic and general feeling of nausea and malaise. Still have a bit of a cough but that’s largely subsided. How long have you and your wife been battling? Hopefully your infant isn’t in any danger health wise? How are your kids - are they progressively getting better or still in the brink of it?"
8411,"Sounds terrible I hope you recover quickly as well as your daughter! Keep your vitamins up such as iron, vitamin d and c. Extremely important in helping fight the virus as this one is quite a nasty one. It left me with dangerously low iron levels that I’m still recovering from. Had to get an emergency iron infusion because iron wasn’t absorbed correctly in the 5-6 weeks that I had it. The pneumonia did clear up but the toll it had on my body was detrimental so keep fluids and nutrition up. Good luck!"
8412,"I’m much better now and I got through it but it left me with a dangerously low iron level, apparently iron was not absorbed correctly in the 5-6 weeks I had the virus so I had to get an emergency transfusion and I’m still recovering from that. The virus has left my system though!"
8413,How are you doing now?
8414,It seems that way from all the news so far - seems I beat it to the punch
8415,"Well at least I have somewhat of an immunity, unless it mutated, then we’re all royally fucked"
8416,"Nothing like that ever happened to me, my oxygen levels never dropped. Hope she has a speedy recovery"
8417,Yes but quite gradually. It took a good six weeks before I felt I was properly over it. I used a Ventolin puffer for the wheezing and rested as much as I could. It was not a nice illness and it knocked me around.
8418,I'd never even heard of it before! I think COVID has educated a lot of people on what stuff regularly does the rounds.
8419,"Yeah I was actually diagnosed quite early if you read my post, only because I was a stubborn bitch and knew something was very wrong despite what the hospital was telling me. They had tests done on me and said nothing was wrong but I knew otherwise and went straight to my GP. He said most people don’t even get diagnosed this early. So I don’t know how early diagnoses would have helped my situation.."
8420,"She would have had antibiotics earlier, which when she started taking them, 2 weeks after falling ill, she had a better recovery from there. The first two weeks she was crook as, but wouldn't go to the doctor."
8421,"I would be really bad for about a week. Then I was ok (not great but ok) for a couple of days then quite bad again. I have a bad habit of not really resting when I’m sick, it was only when I went straight to bed after work and had actual time off that I started to get better. 

The three / four week mark was when I felt I could get myself into the office with any regularity, and around the six week mark was when I started not feeling headachey and unwell the majority of the time. 

Other fun fact I got conjunctivitis for the first time in my adult life when I was particularly bad (so did a colleague) and I had some extended coughing with cloudiness in my chest X-ray which may have contributed to the duration for me as well.  "
8422,What I meant is that I’d be really bad. Then feel like I was getting better only to suddenly be really bad again.  I generally get better quite quickly (or not as sick in the first place). So I didn’t enjoy it at all. Likewise for my husband. Two of my kids also got it and were quite sick (multiple days off school) but weren’t as sick as the adults too. 
8423,[deleted]
8424,It’s fine - he has a point. It is based on other factors… it’s not necessarily comforting or reassuring but it’s logical and practical. Thank you for your support Hurstbridge
8425,"But… that is the treatment for respiratory viruses?  Rest and hydrate, to allow your body time to fight off and recover.  It takes time.  Which, more or less , could be loosely translated as “suck it up and take it easy”.  There is symptom relief of course, but sounds like OP is all over that with visits to ED and presumably their GP."
8426,"The fevers were so bad mate, I was hallucinating. I’ve never experienced anything like it in my life."
8427,"Haven’t been diagonised via a blood test but reading comments makes me think I have it. Went to work yesterday and lasted an hour, sweated up and had dizzy spells came home and slept for 3+ hours."
8428,"Yes, I'm a palliative care doctor. I did some respiratory terms as part of my physician training.

Don't be so harsh on yourself. You are recovering from not just the human metapneumovirus, so you can't apply the same recovery timeframes."
8429,I must admit seeing your post was a good moment for me. I had been thinking maybe something else was going on for me to still be unwell. Boyfriend caught it from me but was over it in days. Bit of a wake up call for me to stay at home and rest instead of trying to push through. Sorry to hear you've had a bad time with it too.
8430,[deleted]
8431,"It’s not just that. Covid seems to cause an extended post viral syndrome - not just in people with obvious long COVID symptoms, but it seems to increase your vulnerability with other viruses (the research about it is still emerging). EBV does a similar thing, as does much of the extended Herpes family. 
Combination of exhausted T cells and blood vessel damage is my guess.
https://www.science.org/content/article/blood-abnormalities-found-people-long-covid"
8432,"If I were you, I would follow the GP's advice but also look for any signs of the infection returning (e.g. a fever) and see a doctor/ED right away if I suspected the infection hadn't been eradicated and was coming back. Otherwise I don't really know the expected course of recovering from pneumonia."
8433,The bubbly chest was about two weeks total. Was still very low energy and quick to lose breath for about 4 weeks or so. Was not a fun time.
8434,"Yeah

Was not expecting reply as this post is 2 months old😂"
8435,"I’d bought her the pulse oximeter early in covid days so they would know if they got really sick when to call the ambulance. She had the idea to check it after she said she felt like she wasn’t getting enough air and was feeling faint, but not the sense to call an ambulance. 

As you said, given it’s a virus all the doctors could give her was cough medicine and asthma inhalers to try and open up her airways a bit. She couldn’t talk without having coughing fits. She’s almost better now, thankfully. 

I hope you make a quick recovery."
8436,"Well I’m happy you finally recovered and that gives me hope that I will too. After reading the plethora of comments my post has, it’s given me great comfort compared to how I was feeling about it this morning"
8437,"We’ve been so Covid focused that we haven’t paid attention to anything else. I was exactly the same, I thought to myself no virus could be worse. I was very wrong"
8438,"If the antibiotics treated the illness then it was more than a virus, since antibiotics don't treat viruses."
8439,Same. Not great at resting but I’ve had no choice. Totally floored by this. Thanks for reply. Helps with managing expectations.
8440,"Exact same for me. First 4 days was new symptom each day. Day 5 fever.  2 weeks pretty much in bed, work if I had to in week 2. Now week 4 and I'll have a good day followed by fatigue and sinus. I have about 10% sense of smell to boot."
8441,"Your comment couldn’t have come at a better time and without better context. Woke up this morning feeling worse (where I previously felt it lifting), started crying on the phone to my father and he’s telling me to hang in there and that it will have stages. Logically I know, but it just feels so frustrating being bed bound for 3 weeks with no feelings of improvement (feelings of malaise)"
8442,">I've been through Ross river virus and monoculosis, COVID     
    
Goddamn son, stop licking door handles!"
8443,"I hear RSV is rough and much worse from HMPV. Especially in the younger ones but yeah, you’re completely right. The more I stress about it, the less I’ll heal. Thank you for your comment"
8444,"Thats Not what you wrote. ""Stop googling and look after yourself"". You've literally said stop whinging, you'll get over it, watch a bit of telly. Zero fucking empathy!"
8445,Haha sounds like you almost had a dmt trip from a virus. Jesus doesn’t sound fun. I’m not at that point mate but I hope you got better
8446,"I think you’re next course of action would be to get a blood screen for it, because that’s exactly how I felt like I was dying and couldn’t stand at one point from the dizziness and the fatigue."
8447,Thank you means a lot to hear you say that - especially from somebody in the field.
8448,"That's made me so happy to hear that! I am so happy to have helped at least one person and not just myself. I initially made the post to comfort my second guessing, as I was doing the same thing as you. I heard stories about people who got over it in days like a normal cold... made me feel invalidated. But to hear that it's helped you has made me feel much better about making the post in the first place. So just remember, we don't all react the same way to the same virus. I hope you have a speedy recovery <3"
8449,"I'm just hoping it's not that long for me because I am in my early 30's. Doctor has said that it's cleared up very well when he examined me 3 days ago but currently still very unwell. Whenever I start second guessing my recovery, I just remember the comments to this post. It has helped me immensely in terms of my emotional wellbeing - physically I still feel like hell lol."
8450,"It says in the paper that T cell activation and immunodeficiency was detected with people who have had Covid in the past. It also says cortisol levels were abnormal. This is a huge indicator to how viruses are then spread and fought after Covid infection. Thanks for the paper, it’s insightful. Not only that - respiratory factors are affected later on…."
8451,Had no idea the virus had such a long term impact on the health and immunological system. The research seems to be immense. Thanks will read up on it - I’m very interested in anything to do with health science as I am a biomed major.
8452,I’m seeing him tomorrow to follow up - just to make sure everything is going as it should be. Plus I’ll get a full blood work up to make sure immune system is in check and no other issues are present. Thank you
8453,Your comment has given me some solace in the fact you mentioned it was 4 weeks. Thank-you and I’m happy that you’re healthy now!
8454,Notifs come straight to my phone 😂 I’ve been replying to every single person who is sick with it for the past two months.. it was living hell for me so I wanna help anyway I can
8455,Thank you and I hope your mother also gets better. It was a good idea on your part to get her the pulse oximeter early. Keep an eye out on her every day… it’s a sneaky virus.
8456,Take care and rest up. Get well soon!
8457,"I didn't get the pneumonia till week 2, that's when I was readmitted to hospital for a round of IV antibiotics and a box to take. Week 1, I didn't have a lung infection of any sort... I just felt really sick and unwell. So early antibiotics wouldn't have helped the case, I was diagnosed with pneumonia as soon as I got the symptoms."
8458,"No worries. I hope you recover nicely and don’t get any sort of secondary infection. 

I was playing a fun view the future game with a colleague. He’d had it about a week longer than me and I pretty reliably developed whatever he had a week after he did. It was the most fun part of the whole ordeal, comparing our notes on experience. "
8459,I’m happy that the community/post gave you some solace? Because I’m currently going on the end of week 3 and still quite un well. Thank you Haylot for your other comment - I did reply to that one. I wish you a speedy recovery Izzy and you bounce back faster!
8460,"I know I’ve improved in other ways, just no energy, shakes and unwellness that’s increased this morning"
8461,"Dude when I read that - I was like, all that is left is the black plague and you're all set 👍 Sounds like he's been through the fucking wringer..."
8462,"I didn’t write that comment, my guy."
8463,"It's okay, some people show empathy in other ways. They show it by being productive and logical, that's their way of helping. What they both said is completely right, (of course not exactly suck it up and take it easy) but they told me that there really isn't any more I can do from my position. Emotionally, it's not the best response but it is valid."
8464,"No need for blood tests, I will finish the antibiotics and rest up and see how I go before heading back to the doctors."
8465,Yep! It definitely seems to change how our immune system is “supposed” to behave and I guess the most worrying part of that is there’s no way of knowing how badly any one person could be affected. It also causes issues with endothelial cells in blood vessels especially and that seems to affect clotting on a micro vascular level even.
8466,"Yes!! The more you read the more terrifying you’ll realise viruses can be 😅 

I mean arguably the most famous post viral syndrome is AIDS -  it can cause  everything from dementia to cancers."
8467,"😂😂 

Oh"
8468,Thank you. Sounds like you had some nasty complications. It’s so hard when the expectation for recovery is less than what you are experiencing. Good luck for your recovery!
8469,lol - thanks for the laugh
8470,"Alright man take it easy, again it’s different for everyone so if you, at any point, feel like death warmed up - time for that blood check!"
8471,"Well I’ve had Covid twice in the past - although I have been previously vaccinated, this could also be a huge reason why this virus has knocked me back so much more than any bug I’ve had in the past. Thank you!"
8472,Well lucky we’re currently in the 2020s and largely AIDS can be managed but I have no idea how it might affect the body later on…
8473,Thank you so much. Sending you well wishes as well!!
8474,No offence but if I am diagnosed with it what can the doctors do for me?
8475,"Yes, but that only happened when people started taking it seriously and researching it. Unfortunately a lot people don’t take Covid seriously."
8476,It’s better to know than to not know so you can apply supportive care to yourself. That’s all you can really do. You’re right. There is no other course of action but I’d prefer to have the knowledge so I know what I’m dealing with.
8477,I am a prime example - I literally said that I’ve had Covid twice and don’t understand the repercussions lol
8478,"Starting to feel human again the last 2 days, I’m hoping I’m over this virus finally after 4 weeks."
8479,Me too! I’m actually much better and have finally broken through this horrible virus. We made it
8480,Ruh-roh. Remember when they were actively downplaying COVID to not embarrass China?
8481,"There needs to be a different term. So far, everyone keeps saying the risk of ""low"" when all that really means is that right this moment, 7:13 pm PST on Tuesday, January 7th, there is no H2H transmission. If we look at this one split second in time, sure. But that covers nothing about all of the factors that have gone into the steadily increasing risk from avian flu over the past 4 and 1/2 years, the future risks stemming from the fact that TWO severe cases in North America have now thrown dangerous mutations after infection, the risks caused by the never-ending bird infections, the risk from the feline infections, etc etc etc. ""Low"" risk refers only to this exact moment while ignoring absolutely all potential risk *surrounding* this moment."
8482,I’m tired boss…
8483,"Eh, ok. Odds of a recession? Low. Inflation going up? Very, very low. Housing crisis? Low. Liquidity issues? Very low. Um, you guys, I think they’re just trying to keep us all calm as the global system is imploding all around us…"
8484,About to send my kid to daycare in 2 weeks and the risk may be low but I don’t feel so great about it :(
8485,"I’m just hoping it doesn’t jump species with the same velocity it has hit the bird population. If it is even close. We are doomed. People in the US are way too stupid to understand, and deal with a real problem."
8486,Yeahhhhhhh … they were useless in early days of Covid it was all geared towards slowing things down for China and we all know how that ended.  With China literally welding Covid positive people into their apartments.
8487,"And keeping borders open without restrictions so the people in china could flee, even when it was clearly an issue."
8488,"Yes. So many things were done for the sake of ""avoiding panic"". Around that time, I read a news article about a study that basically said that people don't panic that way. The stuff that you see in the movies is almost never what really happens, unless there is a nearly total breakdown of social order. And epidemic disruption is not on that scale. 

By withholding information, public health officials and ensured that they lost credibility as the pandemic progressed.

The announcement as it stands is technically true, but only for the present. They should take the attention of the press as an opportunity to prepare the public and to ask for more resources to head off the disease. They should be saying something like:

 ""The level of danger is low for the time being, but could change into a deadly pandemic with only a few mutations to the virus. To prepare for that eventuality, more resources need to be allocated to develop a vaccine to be deployed preemptively while the disease is monitored more closely with widespread testing."""
8489,Why exactly are we making it seem like these 2 severe cases are an anomaly? Bird flu deaths are only literally uncommon this year.
8490,"Agreed. You have identified one of the key problems with the communication from infectious disease scientists to the public and to policymakers. 

In the case of bird flu, the threat remains low, according to official sources. However, evolution is non-linear. It may never go human to human. But if it does, the threat immediately becomes high. 

There will be no “middle threat” level. There should be a way to communicate this. However, policy flows from policy makers which flow from politicians. More and more, politicians are controlled by financial interests exclusively in the short term. If scientists were heeded more generally, this virus likely would have been contained a long time ago. But that would have angered farmers and people that consider egg prices to be the penultimate measure of societal worth. 

The public, for the most part, is not scientifically literate. There are massive risks to causing alarm for something that may not come to fruition. If we had trust in our leaders and/or scientifically literate populations in the UK and the US, a nuanced approach would benefit us all. 

This is why we can’t have nice things."
8491,https://preview.redd.it/2rzjl627jnbe1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d586cf4bdd77b2434b4f4e801f42e40e2bd518b
8492,Odds of this are high.
8493,Same here friend. We start next week.
8494,"Yes. Good point. The problem is that whilst these are the only known severe cases of this clade so far, it didn’t seem to spread human to human. 

Nobody knows for certain if it will at all. 

My personal thoughts on this— In a society in which anti-science rhetoric has become normalized and maliciously equated with an educated understanding of the topic, the nuance will be lost on many. Those “many” are their own sort of threat."
8495,"hMPV like many viruses is particularly harmful in the young, elderly, immunocompromised, and those with preexisting conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart failure, CF, etc. There are also the occasional ""normal, healthy"" people who go down like a ton of bricks. For the remainder of healthy folks they weather it with some misery but otherwise ok."
8496,"A colleague is a big hMPV person, research wise. I asked them what the deal with China is.   Their response was that 1) hMPV does this. Like RSV and other respiratory viruses they come in waves every few years.   2) Since COVID there is increased testing  capacity, reporting requirements and capacity and overall concern and awareness of respiratory viruses.  3)hMPV is a well known cause of LRTI so puts people in hospitals.

Nothing to see here."
8497,"There is nothing unusual about this. HMPV is a seasonal illness. Most people handle it fine. A small number of people get seriously ill. There is no data suggesting that the current spread is more than normal.

My theory is that the social media furor is being driven by [Trump’s well-documented search for a disease to justify closing the border](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/trump-title-42-migrants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)"
8498,Yes but I don’t get the fear. It’s a common cold virus. All of those bastards are mixing together now with Covid and flu and RSV. Your link doesn’t work OP.
8499,"one of our pts yd was hospitalized last week for AHRF 2/2 to hMPV

outpt attending never heard of it haha"
8500,I wasn’t young elderly or immunocompromised and I ended up with bacterial pneumonia from HMPV
8501,"Anecdotally I was a resident during the 21/22 winter and we had probably a couple dozen cases of hmpv needing hospitalization for supportive care, mostly cardiac babies and the like. Hadn’t seen or heard much of it since then until now."
8502,I’m working in China and we’ve seen more influenza and enterovirus in our weekly surveys. A surprising amount of GABS too. In the weekly Chinese CDC report HMPV is always near the top of the most frequent diseases but TB is also in that top ten list. It’s nothing like the crazy hexademic we had last year when the COVID opening happened.
8503,Coronavirus was just a “common cold” virus before Covid came around too
8504,"""Just a common cold virus."" That common cold virus by itself put someone in their early 40's in my household in the hospital for more than a week, gasping for breath and having to be put on nebs etc. They couldn't do anything. Labs were all out of whack. And nothing pre-existing except asthma so mild it was not necessary to treat it before this. 

She was tested for everything under the sun, and nothing was positive but hMPV. I honestly feel that not enough caution is given to what were routine viral infections before, to now since Covid has hit multiple times. Up to date on all vaccines, and it wrecked her."
8505,Not sure why you think this is relevant. SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen. This is not.
8506,"True but SARS and MERS were more in the realm than the common cold was when considering coronaviruses in general imo. But for sure, mutations can occur in “common” viruses and have. Thanks for pointing that out."
8507,[deleted]
8508,"it's not just hmpv. this year has been especially bad with the flu, rhino, parainfluenza, rsv. really all the colds have been kicking butts of anyone with any kind of obstructive airways disease. I know because I have about 13 on my consult list and 3 or 4 have been needing much more aggressive treatments than usual in terms of steroids and nebs that are typically used for exacerbations."
8509,Wow then I apologize for downplaying it. Perhaps there have been mutations that have made it more virulent? That’s for sure true of RSV lately.
8510,"It’s a mutated coronavirus, not novel."
8511,Yes very true re sars/mers
8512,"If I had access to the labs done at the time, I would share that information. Her labs were really off, as was described to us, they did cultures to see if there was a co-infection (there wasnt), and before the cultures came back they threw everything they could at her, including iv vanc. She was on maxed steroids a few days in a row, she was on round the clock neb treatments almost the whole time. So a ""known asthma history"" where in fact she never even needed an inhaler previous to hospitalization doesnt seem routine. 

The doctors didnt exaxtly know why things progressed as they did. Everything was clear but hMPV. And yeah, ""all out of whack"" was essentially the one descriptor that came to mind."
8513,"My question is, do you feel that this is an extension of covid exposure? There was evidence that covid after repeated exposure could cause harm to the immune system, including B Cells. That was a big difference in the household. She was exposed and caught covid probably 4 times, and at least once was before vaccination and it hit her hard. 

While not conclusive, I feel its something to be cautious of going forward for providers as evidence shows altered immune response in long covid patients as well. Even those with asymptomatic covid infections."
8514,It’s been bad enough that I’ve been pondering if it’s happening because I’m getting older. Am I circling back around to my childhood of colds kicking me right in the bronchioles? Every cold I’ve had since covid has been terrible!
8515,"There are reports that a mutation is allowing it to get deeper into the lungs, causing pneumonia that the body can't handle. I apologize if I came off a little rude or curt. The experience was harrowing to say the least. She was sick with it for a week before going into the hospital, and they gave every therapeutic intervention they could to try and get her system to recover. She luckily is now out, but on several meds for worsened and complicated asthma now. 

I feel that because hMPV is ""related"" to RSV in a way, its worth keeping an eye on as it progresses."
8516,that's hard to say. my theory is that these other viruses havr been on the backbrner and people haven't been having exposure to them yearly like before covid  so now it's almost like a brand new virus with an exaggerated immune response.
8517,Dang glad she’s out and hope for the best. Viruses have just been wild since the vid

You could go to a beach of your choice and take a probe of 1L of seawater. Then spend the rest of your scientific career with describing every new virus species found in there. By the end, you won't be done with half of them.

And that's only the viruses at the shore, mind you. Drive 1km out in the bay, take another 1L sample and you have enough viruses for all the PhD students of your PhD students to classify as well."
8622,"hMPV is relatively young; it emerged at least 50 years ago, but likely not more than 150 years ago.

It's probably only has a global distribution since the last few decades. Before the 90's it may have been limited to the Americas. Around 2005 there was a lot of radiative evolution of hMPV, when many new variants emerged that spread rapidly and became prevalent in larger population centers in Asia.

So it may not be that we just never noticed the second most common cause of RTIs, but rather that we saw the early evolution and spread of a new pathogen."
8623,"It's new but not particularly special. There's a ton viruses that cause cold symptoms. There is only one special thing about this one.

8625,"Tell me about it. Up until the 1980's there was a consensus in medicine that babies could not feel pain. Accordingly, pain relief for infants was minimal, often limited to sucrose solutions, even during invasive procedures. Although research in the 1980s began to show that infants have distinct physiological stress responses to pain, many clinicians refused to use it, opting instead for nitrous oxide and muscle relaxing agents that dampen pain rather than block it. Cases such as this one remind us just how much remains unknown, especially in fields involving complex systems like human biology and psychology.

The bigger concern currently is the H5N1 bird flu virus strain that's infecting birds currently. From the latest reports, it seems to be trying to figure out human-to-human transmission. If it indeed achieves that, we probably will have the next pandemic."

8691,Its true i dont know why the media is trying to hype it up.
8692,"This is so strange. People keep saying ""that's what they said before COVID"".  
  
But before COVID even came to Western countries, I have clear memory of doctors were telling us how we need to act and should be very concerned. People were disregarding the pleas of doctors telling us to be more careful.

This is the opposite of what happened during COVID."
8693,"This is exactly how a Zombie movie would start.

I keep hoping..."
8694,"Ding ding ding!  We have a winner for the phrase most often repeated by a government in 2025!  ""No reason to worry.""  Congrats humanity!  No reason to worry!

In all seriousness, I know HMPV is not novel or unusual in any way, and this uptick coincides with the yearly uptick.  Still funny anyone is concerned about causing a panic, after the last collective shrug at an actual pandemic."
8695,"I had HMPV in August. It’s worse than COVID, lots of deep coughing, hard to breathe deeply and I gave it to my whole family. It’s horrible. But I recovered after 2 months with no lasting effects. Time again? I would have tried to isolate more effectively."
8696,But like…travel is a concern and I know of Indian coworkers with family visiting right now so…
8697,I am somehow feeling like I have heard similar stories from few years back about different outbreak…
8698,"Panicking worsens things, and the misinformation can be interpreted in many ways. Still, we all can probably agree it helps to keep the vast majority of ignorant folks from getting out of control."
8699,The reduction of vaccines and access to healthcare will make this fun in the coming months for those of us that live in the United States with the incoming administration.
8700,No wonder 2025 started with the days W T F
8701,COVID was nothing there was no dead people. But people keep spreading miss info of people dying from other diseases.
8702,Who can you trust if not Indian officials?
8703,World was saying same thing about Covid-19 as well but seriously I hope its not really scary as Pandemic caused by Covid-19
8704,"I feel the same way hearing this that women feel when men tell them to “relax.”

I’ve seen this movie before. It was not great."
8705,"The reason experts keep saying it is not worrisome is because HMPV is not new, there has been human transmission for decades (Since 2001 really), and the current uptick does not, for now, look more serious than a bad flu season.


The ""not new"" part is more important than it sounds. Pandemics are usually caused by novel viruses: they are virtually unknown until suddenly exploding in cases. For example, COVID became a pandemic within a span of about 4 months after detection, which happened very shortly after the first animal-human transmission.

Experts are cautioning against panic, and these are the same experts that said COVID could reach pandemic levels back in 2019, so they are not some habitual deniers."
8706,Yeah the first Covid scares were SARS in 03ish and they were very concerned about both in China and out.
8707,"The initial response to COVID from most health authorities in the west was ""Theres no evidence of airborne transfer, just practice good hygeine by washing your hands frequently and sanitizing. Masking is not necessary""

I have no political dog in this fight, but that was absolutely the original position espouted in early 2020. People who were going out and buying masks and respirators were called paranoid. I remember being in a walmart and being one of the only people wearing an N95 and getting weird looks from people.

Soon after this, the advice from authorities switched, and soon there were mask mandates and some people who were previously in the ""paranoid"" crew suddenly were anti-mask entirely,  and the people who were calling them paranoid were now wearing masks and pretending they never made fun of others for wearing them."
8708,"back in the first week of january 2020 when we saw the first footage on reddit from china emerge and go viral, before it had arrived in europe yet - officials were calming the public down, saying it's not a big thing and we shouldn't be worried, heck china itself was misleading the public back then. it's also when the famous: it's just the flu, posts started on reddit from redditors.

one major issue that caused a huge shift in trust away from public officials, was their strategy to avoid a panic by misdirecting and misleading the public. famous example here in switzerland is when we were told masks weren't effective tools. (a statement that was made in the early days as there weren't enough masks and healthcare workers needed them first) - that strategy ultimately lead to a massive loss of trust in public officials, as everyone now understood that government officials weren't truthful, in order to avoid any form of panic to onset and to secure supply of critical resources. which begs the question: why should they be trusted going forward, if they don't trust the public to handle the truth."
8709,"Alarm started when covid arrived to Spain and Italy in mass cases that was like two or three weeks after Wuhan was a war zone and nobody gave af.

I remember entering into wuhan reddit every day seeing videos of people being taken from the streets while everybody screaming or authorities closing every residential building with chains and hospitals and sports center full of people or cars trying to get out of that city or the audio about a crematory saying they had 10x cases of deaths per day and it was increasing exponentially until they started blocking all the internet connections and nobody here knew nothing or there was any restriction nor health recommendation about it by then.

I even remember, like a week before it arrived in Spain that one guy at work tried to hug me and I moved away and he was, like ""you do strange things lately, are you ok?"" like I was mad xD"
8710,"I remember seeing a sign posted during covid. It said ""This plague sucks I wanted zombies""."
8711,Go wear your mask weirdo
8712,Did they actually  test you for it?
8713,"Nah, I feel there was panic from day 1 about covid.

I dint remember seeing one serious article that was like ""that virus thing in China? It's gonna be over in a week"""
8714,"Too early, we used to have around 8 years in-between outbreaks"
8715,"I was thinking the same, what a coincidence 😅😅"
8716,"If you had bothered to read the article, you would know that it's not the Indian officials who said there is nothing to worry about."
8717,India handled the pandemic better than a lot of western countries.
8718,For some reason hearing China and India tell the rest of the world “don’t worry about it” is making me REAAAAALLLLLLLLLYYYYYYY worry about it.
8719,"Right?!


Third world nations that sends millions of immigrants to the west each year gets a new contagious disease?


Nothing to worry about here."
8720,Thit hit me when you say 'decades' referring to 2001....damn I'm getting old haha!
8721,"My only gripe with the history of COVID is the belief we found and reported the first cases ever of a novel virus in Wuhan, China.

I think it's completely ridiculous to believe when an unknown respiratory illness was spreading through the US killing people who used vapes 6 months prior.

I also starkly remember multiple manufacturers telling me a flu had taken out their entire production team, in September 2019. Wuhan didn't happen until December 2019.

Wuhan, imo, was simply the first place a doctor finally decided to research and culture the virus."
8722,"The worst of it is that they were not wrong. The public cannot be trusted to handle the truth, just look at what happened to toilet paper when shit hit the fan.

It sucked that they had to lie, but the priority, like you said, is securing critical resources and trying to maintain order, as is usually the priority in any kind of emergency."
8723,"Sounds like a movie.
I wonder what would the us or some country in eu do if it started there instead.
Like would they act differently and would it spread out or not."
8724,"Yes, it's part of a pneumonia panel test we do in hospitals when you're admitted. It's been around in US since last summer?"
8725,There was about a month of questionable stuff happening in China before it got taken seriously. Helped that Covid was really quick in spreading to West.
8726,"In September of 2019, when it was first noted?  No, there was absolutely no panic or worldwide concern about a few cases of SARS in China.  We, the citizenry, absolutely expected nothing of this in our area until like Jan or Feb 2020."
8727,"You drop dead from the Alpha virus and they tried to hide it till too many were dropping dead that it is causing a panic already


Edit: How are you all forgetting how many died. It's only been four, five years!"
8728,"covid 2019 started in well….. you guessed it. 2019. duuuuh

but was there anyone who even heard about it in 2019?

It was 2020 we started hearing about it, barely january. It was almost in february that it became serious news."
8729,"Have some family member who are doctors. They mentioned some papers suggesting that due to global warming virus and bacteria pathogens have longer active periods, so they are mutating faster leading to higher rates of infection."
8730,"People here will say negative things about India over anything be it space missions, fake news,etc. But try to critize America over anything like their history of foreign interference and suddenly there will be rabid replies about how you can't call America bad"
8731,"Uh, do you remember the Delta wave, where they just piled up the bodies on the streets in front of hospitals, because they couldn't handle the amount of people dying?"
8732,"well its opposite , billion population containing countries having only 3 -4 cases , u should be happy about it ?"
8733,My bet would be that this was designed virus being studied that somehow got out of containment in China.  That is just my opinion based on what I have seen and read in some of medical journals the last couple of years
8734,"Army of NPCs downvoting. Tons of people I know were getting sick with unexplained respiratory illnesses, coming back negative for everything. Just cause we hadn’t identified it yet doesn’t mean it hadn’t already spread"
8735,"It would have been the same, in fact China probably contained the thing a little more, because even their cities population are like an entire country here, they could do authoritarian measures from the start, like dragging people down to the hospital if found with symptoms.

I remember reading from back then, that they did mandatory in house even worst than us, because officer from gov went door by door to give food and measure fever or coughing, if somebody had symptoms they were forced to go to hospital."
8736,"There was a bad response happening, yes. And the Chinese authoritarian government was being itself. 

But the media wasn't known for downplaying covid, quite the opposite"
8737,I was looking for FFP2 masks on Amazon in December 2019 due to the cases around the fresh meat market. nobody sold any.
8738,"What? I don't remember that happening. Even in European countries like Greece had Bodies on the street wrapped up in Paper. Try to be Racist better if that's what you're trying lol. But if it's a serious question, no, I do not remember that happening."
8739,lol. If you believe their bullshit.
8740,"It's okay, upvotes and down votes are simply a reflection of collective opinion and not necessarily a representation of fact.

Today we still have large groups of COVID deniers, people who want to believe China is the source of all evil, and blind following of authority figures. Any contrarian will be down voted.

If reddit existed pre-Aristotle, you'd be down voted everywhere for claiming the earth is round."
8741,Same i live in America and since new year we have been missing half the staff. At first I thought people just didn't want to work and then I was told by them that they really was sick. I spoke to one person who said they don't usually get sick but felt flu and respiratory problems. They went to emergency room and it was pack. I told her about hmpv and she fits the symptoms.
8742,"They totally downplayed it, even when chinese bought masks in every western country to send it to china or when they build a hospital in a couple of days, western media kept saying like that was overreaction and we would be completely safe until the outbreak in Italy and Spain that made it clear that was already a global thing, then sure, they did everything and more but there was 3-4 weeks were health ministers were saying everything was under control and nobody should worry at all."
8743,"You are remembering incorrectly.

They absolutely downplayed it, discouraged wearing masks and siting the WHO stating there was ""zero evidence of airborne transmission"" and that washing your hands and sanitizing surfaces would suffice.

Many people were mocked and called paranoid for wearing masks in those early days, myself included. Then suddenly everyone else was doing the same, and conveniently acted like they never downplayed it and called others paranoid."
8744,"my point is, whether this is serious or not, if it keeps showing up in the news, it’s good to be considered as worrisome enough. So best to buckle up"

8814,"This post is **speculative** and represents an **individual’s opinion**. Please note the source via the post link. Let’s keep the discussion open, but engage with this information at your own discretion."
8815,"Interesting. I didn't realize that SARS2 was killing 1 in 4 at its beginning down to 1 in 7 by Feb '22. I had believed that it was in fact about 1 in 10 - but the data was admittedly hard to gleen as all the sites kept a running total, rather than data that could be broken down by time frame. 

If I am not mistaken, last I recall, Flu A/B was killing about 1.5 per 100k. And SARS2 (aka Covid-19) was killing roughly 18 per 100k - yes, still much more deadly than Flu A/B. These days verifying the numbers is even more difficult.

At such low numbers, hMPV does not sound like the current culprit in China, as the current mortality rate is about 1 in 3 (from what has been reported). Unless perhaps it has mutated, but we won't know that for a few more months in all likelihood.

In the meantime, ordering more masks seems smart. AFAIK there's no vaccine for hMPV."
8816,Interesting opinion and I am too bit worried that there is something really serious hiding under hMPV fear monger
8817,Do you have a source for that '1:3 (what has been reported)'
8818,"Couldn’t agree more. Thanks for the opinion OP, I think a lot of us are wondering what’s being hidden behind the numbers we can see."
8819,"Definitely worth keeping an eye on, especially after posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/s/PaPDySdHln) over at r/China

8869,These types of viruses were made in a lab. They are bio weapons like the Covid 19. These viruses cannot jump from Animal to human but they have been engineered to do that. There are 30 biolabs moved from Ukraine to Africa. They say are helping Africans by distributing vaccines 💉. These vaccines are killing people left and right and they are Bill Gates funded.
8870,"The game is survival and reproduction. Different DNA strands are competing for limited resources and energy and produce different organisms which use different tactics to survive and reproduce. A flour that attracts more pollinators is better at reproducing aka that DNA code is better. Pretty much everything we do, language, clothes, society, jobs and everything is just to help our DNA code survive and reproduce. 


In fact our empathy is directly connected to this. We have the most empathy for ourselves, our family, and  friends who are the most likely to share DNA with us. We then care about our community, country, and region who again are more likely to share DNA with us than other regions. Then we usually care about humans more than other creatures (killing a chicken isn't murder). Then we care about mammals or creatures like us more than snakes or frogs. Then we care more about animals than plants generally. Then we care more about large organisms than microorganisms and so on. The more similar a beings DNA is to us the more compassionate we are. The more different it is the less compassionate we are. 


No why have this compassion in the first place? Because we are pack mammals and it was useful for survival and reproduction aka winning the game."
8871,"You know nearly all diseases that have posed a serious threat to humanity have been zoonotic (transfer from an animal host to humans). The bubonic plague is a classic example and other corona virus strains have jumped from an animal to humans in the past like mers and sars. 


I'm not saying what you are saying is impossible but also we have a long long history of zoonotic diseases spanning millennia and a track record of zoonotic coronaviruses.

The government can do a lot of things, but that doesn't mean I want it to happen.

Remember, lockdown will cost the government a ton of money, and we are just now recovering from COVID damage. If gov puts a lockdown that means a lot of people are ill, hospitalised or worse dead, and those people can be anyone, your family, friends or even you.

So please be careful what you wish for. There are a lot of things that can be done to make our standard of living better, but economic shutdown is one of the worst."

>Budi menyebutkan bahwa HMPV adalah virus lama yang ditemukan pada 2001 dan sudah beredar di seluruh dunia sejak itu, dan selama ini tidak ada kejadian besar akibat itu. Selain itu, dia pun menepis pemberitaan tentang naiknya kasus HMPV di China.

>""Nomor dua, apakah HMPV naik tinggi di China tahun 2024? Tidak benar juga. Sudah dibantah sama Pemerintah China, sudah dibantah juga oleh WHO (Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia). Jadi itu hoaks berita itu, ya, teman-teman,"" kata Budi menambahkan.

9038,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) memang menimbulkan kekhawatiran karena kemunculannya kembali, namun beberapa ahli menyatakan bahwa HMPV tidak mungkin menyebabkan pandemi baru seperti COVID-19. Beberapa alasan mengapa HMPV tidak mungkin menjadi pandemi seperti COVID-19 adalah:

- Bukan virus baru
- Sebagian besar orang memiliki kekebalan: Kebanyakan orang, terutama anak-anak, telah terinfeksi HMPV sebelum usia 10 tahun, sehingga memiliki kekebalan terhadap virus ini. Kekebalan ini membuat infeksi ulang cenderung lebih ringan.
- Tingkat kematian rendah: Meskipun HMPV dapat menyebabkan penyakit parah pada kelompok rentan, tingkat kematiannya secara umum rendah. Berbeda dengan COVID-19 yang memiliki tingkat kematian yang signifikan, terutama pada awal pandemi.
- Penyebaran tidak secepat COVID-19
- Gejala umumnya ringan
- Tidak ada bukti mutasi signifikan"

9123,"That’s not unique to China. Just look how abysmal the U.S. Covid response was - I’ve lived my whole life in America and people cough without covering their mouths all the time. Moreover, the common attitude that many Americans have towards masking is they usually don’t mask up until *after* they get sick. So if Asian Americans mask up as a precautionary measure (even while they are not sick), other Americans just think they’re sick.

I’d argue that it’s less of a cultural issue, and more of an educational issue that affects both China and the U.S.

Education should include basic life skills such as financial literacy and technology usage; sanitation and health science should be added to that list as well"

9130,"After all said and done in our household of three, about a month. Worst was the kid had a very high fever on and off for more than a week. Motrin could knock it down after the first few days, but it just kept coming back."

I doubt that this is a serious source"
9132,Who said that and how is it fact checked ?
9133,"the thing is India news just want to be negative on China every chance it gets, so i tend to avoid it."
9134,Pussy? it's a band you play in?
9135,go fuck yourself.
9136,"Generally lack soap, and always lack hot water"
9137,"Yep, mostly the older people are still the ones spitting and blowing their noses on the floor inside restaurants, malls, supermarkets, etc. They'll even hold their grandbaby over a trash can to defecate instead of using diapers. But at least they're not always letting them go on the middle of the floor. Outside is a different story, you have to watch where you walk. I've lost count the amount of times I've seen kids defecate on the sidewalk, boys and girls."
9138,It is unique to China. Lack of basic hygiene knowledge leading to serious diseases and pandemic.
9139,Asian Americans are generally well educated. In Asia it’s a huge mix of education levels. I keep getting back to the fundamental lack of soap in public places in China. That can’t be good. Most the time it appears either not installed (who knows where it’s going) or simply stolen as is any attempt at public toilet paper. Also the level of education in Asia varies massively. Workers coming in from the countryside and have no Hukou in Beijing for example (yet work there) make up about 20% of the population and often lack the education you describe
9140,What are you on about? I never said any of that.
9141,Ppl calling Covid fake was way overblown 99% of ppl know it’s real they just don’t know where it came from if yk what im saying
9142,"Thanks for answering. I did research and it says all children by age 5 get infected with hMPV, though immunity doesn't last."
9143,"Wow, sounds excousting. And what country are you from if I may ask."
9144,"Following this, don't mind me."
9145,"Very true, but it’s still good to check all the local news sources just in case you can get any legit insight into what’s occurring."
9146,"OK.. You're still a pussy. ""Oh no! I'm scared of everything 😩"" LOL"
9147,Then why the same thing didn't happen in india when we very well know that low educated people there(the majority) also lack in hygiene awareness. Why only China? This hmpv virus infection has been reported much earlier in the US. 
9148,"Look at the genome sequence, it looks man-made, I actually am a member of DRASTIC and looked into covid origins"
9149,Oooo we got a real sigma on our hands lads.. when do you turn 15
9150,"What a weak rebuttal with whataboutism characteristics.

9175,"I assumed what they'd do is get each of these developed, tested, and approved separately and then combine them into a single shot for convenience. Will be interesting if it goes another way. There's already an antibody infusion for RSV for premature babies."
9176,Great. But…why? Who needs to be blocked from these infections all the time? What would the use of this be?
9177,"As a parent of two kids in daycare, me

Also, if you look at the article- immunocompromised people is the real answer"
9178,Old people can get wrecked by RSV
9179,But it is NOT REASONABLE to give your kids regular antibody infusions to prevent these infections. Even in healthcare settings for immunocompromised folks I am concerned it wouldn’t be
9180,They won't generally need this though because two different RSV vaccines for older adults are going to be approved imminently in the US. But infusions like this are maybe better when your body doesn't respond as well to vaccination related to being immunocopromised. Like chemo patients.
9181,"Absolutely. But antibody infusions are not an appropriate prophylactic response to that.

I’m sorry, I think my original comment was frustrated and flippant because this article is actually an advertisement that is trying to drum up interest in a biotech company. This product is not useful in the form it is in and in what is being developed. It’s just a pop science advertisement and it shouldn’t be in this sub."
9182,Who said anything about that?
9183,You? You said this would be useful for your kids. But the infusion in development by this company is a pretty significant thing. I’m not sure even most daycare families would prefer an IV infusion every few months to a risk of RSV once a year.
9184,"No, I said it would be useful for me, jokingly, then said that the real audience is immunocompromised people. No one is considering giving infusions of antibodies to healthy children. Otherwise, that would already be happening for RSV. Would love to be vaccinated for all of these soon though."

> Currently, there is not enough information from reliable sources on the extent and severity of a possible HMPV outbreak in China to accurately predict the risk of a pandemic.

Peak marketing scheme though.  Ride the fears of COVID to something that's been around from decades and capitalize on peoples fear.  There is just so much money to be made on fear, from giving places like CBS clicks and ad revenue to food and PPE sales.

9327,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world."
9328,"Here's a preview of the story: 

Indian officials have confirmed the vast nation's first cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with seven people said to have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.

Medical News: Surge in Cases Raises Concerns
China has been grappling with a marked increase in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections and related hospitalizations since mid-December 2024.

Reports from various provinces indicate a steady rise in cases, creating apprehension about the possibility of a novel viral outbreak. However, health officials have emphasized that HMPV is not a new virus but a relatively under-recognized respiratory pathogen.

  Experts have pointed out that HMPV is often overshadowed by more widely known respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). This Medical News report aims to provide a detailed and accessible explanation of the situation, delving into the latest developments and their implications.

  Spotlight on New HMPV Lineages
Researchers in China have recently identified new lineages of HMPV belonging to subtype A2. These lineages reportedly exhibit significant mutations in three key proteins, raising questions about their potential impact on disease severity and transmission.

While detailed data has not yet been made public, early findings have prompted a closer investigation. Some scientists have speculated that these mutations could make the virus more neurotrophic, meaning it may have a higher likelihood of affecting the nervous system.

  Also, many local media reports are mentioning about infected individuals feeling a sense of dizziness and also cognitive issues, and also cases of children and the elderly being admitted due to encephalitis are all  indirectly validating that the new HMPV lineages could be more neurotrophic after all.

  Domestic media outlets have noted that many individuals with HMPV infections are experiencing flu-like symptoms, such as dizziness, persistent cough, and fatigue. However, experts caution that these symptoms are non-specific and overlap significantly with those of other respiratory illnesses.

  A Familiar but Often Overlooked Threat
HMPV is not a new pathogen. Discovered in 2001, it has been circulating globally for over six decades, causing infections across all age groups. According to Zheng Lishu, a virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus typically causes mild symptoms that resolve within a week. However, i t can lead to severe complications in vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

  Ruan Zhengshang, an infectious disease expert at Xinhua Hospital in Shanghai, has advised the public not to self-diagnose based on symptoms alone. “It is not accurate to differentiate between influenza, HMPV, and other respiratory infections based on the severity of fever or dizziness,” he explained. Instead, he urged individuals with worsening symptoms to seek professional medical evaluation.

  Challenges in Diagnosis
Unlike influenza or COVID-19, HMPV does not yet have widely available rapid diagnostic tests. Laboratory testing, while accurate, is both expensive and time-consuming, posing a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, many cases may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed as other respiratory illnesses.

  Managing and Preventing Infections
Tang Lanfang, a pediatric respiratory specialist from Children’s Hospital at Zhejiang University, has highlighted the need for vigilance among parents and caregivers. Severe cases of HMPV can lead to pneumonia, especially in children. Symptoms such as persistent high fever, worsening cough, lethargy, and shortness of breath should prompt immediate medical attention.

  Currently, there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for HMPV. Management focuses on supportive care, including adequate rest, hydration, and symptom relief. Preventive measures are crucial and include wearing masks, frequent hand washing, ensuring proper ventilation, and avoiding crowded spaces - guidelines echoed by both Chinese and international health authorities.

  Concluding Thoughts
The ongoing rise in HMPV infections in China underscores the need for heightened awareness and continued research. The emergence of new lineages within subtype A2 raises important questions about the virus’s behavior and its potential implications for public health. While most cases remain mild, the risk to vulnerable groups highlights the importance of prevention and timely medical intervention.

9409,"I am here because I do believe another pandemic could be imminent. I also see some very strange signs of upcoming weirdness. Number one was the UFO thing that went on for a while. I think this might actually be part of the puzzle. Two, was trump and the republicans winning the election. And complete control of the US government(I also think this was huge). Third, was the almost coordinated terrorist attacks carried out by what appear to be Americans, for Isis? Fourth, would be the bird flue outbreak among birds. The wild bird population in my area is decimated. Fifth, as I drive into downtown Seattle all recently, all the flags on the tall downtown buildings are at half mast. Sixth,Today in my general area. I saw two of  what looked like tactical military inner city vehicles. With what appeared to be military personnel manning them. I did not see any emblems at all marking their distinction. I do have a few pictures, and a short video of them. I have not done a review of them yet. I do have a picture of what appears to be a UFO. That was from about two weeks before the craze. But I do believe a huge pandemic may be coming. And it's mostly because of some our nations choices as of late. I do hope for the best, and peace for all. If what I think is going to happen, happens. We won't have to worry about political bs for a while. It will be the least of our worries. Peace all. And lets all hope and pray we never hear about this crap again. The military vehicles in my neighborhood today was disturbing at best."

We had terrible headaches, very weak, he had a high fever that was very difficult to manage, severe congestion with the absolute worst mucus, and here we are in January and we both still have a slight cough and occasionally still coughing up some mucus. I have also noticed that I’ve been having issues with severe fatigue and even Dysesthesia. It’s very odd. And can’t seem to get any answers 🤷🏼‍♀️"

HMPV often causes common cold symptoms, manifested as cough, fever, nasal congestion and wheezing, but sometimes it can result in bronchitis and pneumonia in severe cases,"" said China's CDC. The CDC further said ""In susceptible individuals with underlying medical conditions, HMPV infection can lead to death.

HMPV infections can cause severe and even fatal disease in immunocompromised patients 2, 3, with crude reported mortality rates from HMPV pneumonia ranging from 10% to 80% in different small cohort studies of cancer and/or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients 3, 4, 5, 6."

9682,This is not a new virus. We have been testing for it for years. Pretty common respiratory virus. The virus was discovered in like 2000. The testing in the form of the respiratory virus panels have been around for about 12 years. I have seen hMNP cases in the ICU and hospital setting since residency/since testing started.
9683,"This is the one of the RSV viruses, right?"
9684,"By Chloe Mayer: 

There are fears that human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is spreading further across Asia after two sick babies were hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus in India.

China earlier revealed it has been grappling with a spike of patients suffering from the flu-like respiratory infection caused by the virus this winter. The surge in cases—which seems to have particularly affected children—has swept across northern China, but the country has played down fears of another Covid-style pandemic, with politicians noting that such illnesses are common during the winter months.

9686,"This release addresses reports we have seen that hospitals are overwhelmed with hMPV and other respiratory infections. It states the following:

>>In China, influenza is the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen currently affecting people with acute respiratory infections. **WHO is in contact with Chinese health officials and has not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns.**

This is good news."

Best part is no scary chemicals were ever used during this experiment. The only ""scary"" thing was one injection of water with *Y. pestis* during the infected gerbil transmission to mice part but other than that the authors demonstrated that fleas transmit plague.

Oh and as a bonus question how is this isolation paper of the bacterium *Rickettsia raoultii* valid while every single virus isolation is psuedoscience?

In all 9 experiments, 0/49 men became sick after being exposed to sick people or the bodily fluids of sick people. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/221687

In November 1919, 8 separate experiments were conducted by Rosenau et al. in a group of 62 men trying to prove that influenza is contagious and causes disease. In all 8 experiments, 0/62 men became sick. Another set of 8 experiments were undertaken in December of 1919 by McCoy et al. in 50 men to try and prove contagion. Once again, all 8 experiments failed to prove people with influenza, or their bodily fluids cause illness. 0/50 men became sick. In 1919, Wahl et al. conducted 3 separate experiments to infect 6 healthy men with influenza by exposing them to mucous secretions and lung tissue from sick people. 0/6 men contracted influenza in any of the three studies. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30082102?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents

In 1921, Williams et al. tried to experimentally infect 45 healthy men with the common cold and influenza, by exposing them to mucous secretions from sick people. 0/45 became ill. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19869857/

In 1924, Robertson & Groves exposed 100 healthy individuals to the bodily secretions from 16 different people suffering from influenza. The authors concluded that 0/100 became sick as a result of being exposed to the bodily secretions. https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/34/4/400/832936?redirectedFrom=fulltextA

In 1930, Dochez et al. attempted to infect a group of men experimentally with the common cold. The authors stated in their results, something that is nothing short of amazing. “It was apparent very early that this individual was more or less unreliable and from the start it was possible to keep him in the dark regarding our procedure. He had inconspicuous symptoms after his test injection of sterile broth and no more striking results from the cold filtrate, until an assistant, on the second day after injection, inadvertently referred to this failure to contract a cold. That evening and night the subject reported severe symptomatology, including sneezing, cough, sore throat and stuffiness in the nose. The next morning he was told that he had been misinformed in regard to the nature of the filtrate and his symptoms subsided within the hour. It is important to note that there was an entire absence of objective pathological changes”. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19869798/

In 1937 Burnet & Lush conducted an experiment exposing 200 healthy people to bodily secretions from people infected with influenza. 0/200 became sick. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2065253/

In 1940, Burnet and Foley tried to experimentally infect 15 university students with influenza. The authors concluded their experiment was a failure. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1940.tb79929.x"

Killingley B, et al. Use of a human influenza challenge model to assess person-to-person transmission: proof-of-concept study. J Infect Dis. 2012 Jan 1;205(1):35-43.

“After inoculation, 4 of 9 donors developed symptoms consistent an influenza-like illness (ILI) and 7 of 9 were proven to be influenza-infected. After exposure, 4 of 15 recipients developed symptoms of ILI and 3 of 15 were proven to be infected.“

They calculates an adjusted secondary attack rate of 25% which is consistent with secondary attack rates observed in households in epidemiological studies.

9711,"You will once you realize terrain theory violates much of physics, chemistry, and biology.  It can't be falsifiable. There are at least 4 to 5 distinct, unique, and wholly contradictory versions of terrain theory that are seen amongst terrain theory supporters."
9712,">tell me the replication factor of your fake virus is. what's the biochemistry chain that allows animal cells to replicate viral dna/rna? how much energy does the cell use and what material is used to create copies of viral rna/dna? why does replicating virus cause respiratory distress? make up shit that dont hurt people.

1. The ""biochemistry chain"" is the exact same process a cell uses to build any protein. Viral mRNA gets into the cell via virion. Said mRNA gets introduced to the ribosomes. Ribosomes build viral proteins. Viral proteins assemble into full virion. The process repeats until the cell bursts and dies which causes cellular damage and answers your question about why a replicating virus causes damage.

2. The material used to build a virus are amino acids because yet again the virus uses the same cellular machinery. Same deal for energy use: ATP.

3. The only shit being made up is terrain theory. Viruses follow the same exact protein synthesis every other protein follows so unless biochemistry is a total lie, your pet theory has quite a bit of plot holes. For example qhy do we see Yersinia pestis or Ebola virus in diseased tissue of sick people?"
9713,"You do know the experiments done during the 1920s all used bacteria, right? It's *LITERALLY* on the first paragraph of the Rosenau paper under the heading ""Experiment at Gallops.""  *PFEIFFER'S BACILLUS* is a bacteria."
9714,"As another person just said, it is only if you ignore all data that shows viruses exist that you can maintain your virus denial beliefs.

Here are [pictures of flu virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6744253/)from people who died from flu. Why do the flu capsid shapes always look the same? But other virus capsids like rabies look completely different? Why can we predict this by sequencing the rna genomes of these viruses and recreate these capsids by expressing the proteins from them in controlled settings? 

Here is an example where [deliberate flu infection of humans did work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959521/). There are many more that you ignored.

Why is it that users with “truth” in their name work as hard as possible to avoid it?"

9719,"**-no control group**

-""all volunteers were given a 5-day course of oseltamivir""

-all symptoms experienced (stuffy nose, muscle aches, sore throat headache) are all consistent with side effects of oseltamivir, PCR swabbing and confinement. The authors even note it: ""Although the majority of recipients experienced symptoms after EE, **most were not clinically significant and may relate to the effect of quarantine itself (eg, nasal congestion due to confinement indoors)**""

9729,"Also, why are you so quick to debunk the study from the great flu by discrediting their methods. Surely it is 'science' in its rawest form, experimentation. The accepted method that the flu spreads is said to be in the droplets of moisture from the lungs, ergo taking a confirmed infected patient and having them expel moisture rich lung air into a willing recipient should yield the perfect conditions for viral transfer. Along with this further bodily fluids were included just to make sure no other method of transfer was missed. 

If that does not produce the result of someone being infected then clearly something is wrong with the transmission theory. Millions of people have flu each year, being unable to replicate such a common occurrence without 'modern technology' is the biggest cope I have ever heard."

OP is conveniently cutting and pasting the segments that agree with their ego while ignoring contradictory evidence, from their own selected studies and the hundreds of others that would disagree with their thesis.

This thread is entirely not-serious in its endeavor for ""truth."" It is counter-culture, not scientific by any means. Googling for decades-old ""debunks"" of microbial theory is a waste of time.

The alternative is accepting them all as valid, which is also a win for germ theory, because you can have a million studies saying something doesn't exist, but all you need is one that proves it does exist to invalidate them :)"

Tell me you are a pathological liar without telling me you are a pathological liar. Like, it's legitimately pathetic. You can't even explain what the experiment was about so you gotta resort to cherry picking. 

Case in point:

>""The lungs of the groups infected with virus and bacteria were histologically similar and undistinguishable from those of the viral and bacterial group controls mock infected with PBS.""

And yet you can't explain how the flu group developed worse cases than any other groups. As I've said this is an obvious case of cherry picking. Like embarrassingly obvious. Good job lying pos, you've played yourself."
9749,"Your 'proof' is utterly absurd, squirting a cocktail of chemicals into the nose at various doses and some people getting ill is no proof of viral transmission. It is simply proof that the body can handle certain amounts of poison/toxins/noxious chemicals, but when the load is too high it will attempt to stop further exposure (making you feel like shit so that you rest) and attempt to flush the area where foreign matter was detected. 

Also transmission requires both a sender and a receiver. 

LoL at household transmission. The very same metric can be used to prove that obesity is a transmitted virus. 

You are dodging the fact that we are lead to believe that passing an infected stranger, or sitting near someone on a train for a few minutes can (and will) lead to becoming infected by them. 

Despite the absolutely abundant instances of people having flu we still require them to come to a lab and have a 'virus' squirted directly into their nose (and with the 'viral load' being high enough) before we can prove transmission? How many times have you had someone sneeze directly into your nose? Maybe you walk around with a snorkel ready to catch someone's expulsions? (obviously the tube bit goes up your nose)

Do you ever even think about these 'experiments' logically? You clearly don't or you would see the massive disconnect between your lab experiment and real world scenarios (where flu 'transmission' is rife)."
9750,"No, it does not look you do see at all. You are still having issues understanding. 

You should really stop trying to play chess and spend some more time logically thinking about the experiments on both sides of the debate. I would suggest you first examine your own experiences of illness (flu/colds in particular) and look at the surrounding conditions. It may help if you suspend your disbelief and concentrate not on what you want to believe, but on what was actually verifiable (even if you are the only one that can verify it)."
9751,">And yet you can't explain how the flu group developed worse cases than any other groups.

Buffered saline vs a weird concoction containing the kidney cells of a dog, among other things. Of course if there was an isolated 'virus' in what they administered you could blame it on that. Too bad that wasn't the case."

You know this brings up something I've noticed among germ theory deniers/terrain theory supporters. Not once can they name a single specific toxin/chemical/poison/negative emotion/etc that has been shown to cause the flu, Ebola, rabies, plague, tuberculosis, etc.  In fact no one even gives advice on how to *avoid* them. The only thing said is to let your body kill itself as it ""detoxifies"" itself of these unknown nebulous toxins.  Why suffer if you can easily avoid the toxin or whatever that's responsible for causing your ailments. And this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface that is the abysmal failure of terrain theory to explain why common causes don't cause rare events at a more common occurrence. As an example I've seen rabies be blamed on malnutrition/famine (after much poking and questioning done). Over a billion people across the planet are malnourished and rabies only has ~56,000 cases per year with the majority focused in India. No terrain theory supporter can explain this massive discrepancy."
9753,[removed]
9754,Are you invalidating all of the studies due to low population or are you accepting them? :)
9755,"If I drink tap water can I avoid them accidentally letting raw sewage into the system? No. 

If I eat shop bought vegetables can I avoid them using heavy-metal-based insecticides? No. 

Can I avoid pollution if I walk around a city? No. 

Can I avoid stress? No. 

Can I avoid cold dreary weather (without moving country)? No. 

Personally I would question whether a known chemical/element causes symptoms similar to a particular disease. For example Polio and heavy metal poisoning (look at spinal lesions if you are actually interested). Small pox and serious malnutrition coupled with severe bedbug infestation (and subsequent bug fecal matter composition). The most recent ebola incident that I am aware of was said to be due to a tainted malaria vaccine which affected aid workers. (special mention of tainted vaccines goes to Bill Gates and his Polio vaccine in India). Other than that the ebola virus only seems to be present in African countries where I am sure they don't have the best safety standards for chemical fertilisers and the like. 

My personal belief is that both flu and colds are not viruses but are just a general bodily warning system. Each person has their own personal threshold for the amount of nasties their body can easily vanquish (based on age, fitness, diet etc). If the body becomes slightly overwhelmed (or doesn't understand why its temperature has fluctuated so much in a short space of time - see current UK weather change over the past week or two) it brings about the symptoms associated with having a cold to force you to take it easy and not increase the strain. If further nasties are added (or a greater hit of nasties in one go) the body tries to limit activity and promote rest which results in flu symptoms. If you want to test this theory I would suggest that you ingest large amounts of nasties in the form of alcohol. You will notice that the majority of hangover symptoms are the exact same as flu symptoms. Albeit with vomiting replacing nasal discharge due to the method of consumption of said nasties. 

As for your rabies bit, personally I would look up what else causes light/water aversion and foaming at the mouth, taking a look at the composition of the saliva of canines in particular as this seems to be the source of transmission. So, it would be something that is present in the dog and being released into the saliva. 

Sadly I don't have the funding to investigate these kind of things personally."
9756,"So you are telling me that to replicate something that supposedly happens in passing strangers (and millions of times each year) you must take a swab directly from someone's nose, cultivate that, add stabilizers, buffers, salt etc etc then directly squirt that (at sufficient dose) into someone's nose? 

Wow, that totally proves viral transmission! And it is in no way different from real world conditions which produces countless cases. 

You really think that this far removed from reality set of conditions producing some nonsense result that cant be proven without modern technology constitutes proof of viral transmission? It only proves that you can force somebody to absorb RNA through the nose (when the dose is high enough etc etc). Obviously this is just means that you can administer covid shots (and any other terrible self replicating sequence) without needing to actually inject someone. A terrifying prospect."

Seeking Alpha: Moderna: High Upside Potential At Current Prices- Moderna is a high reward bet on mRNA technology succeeding in either preventing or curing many difficult to treat diseases.
The 58% pullback from Moderna's all-time high of $497.49 gives aggressive growth investors a chance to buy into a company with significant potential upside.

9855,I quite enjoyed staying at home
9856,I'll take another paid vacation.
9857,bro unlocked a pov for me i never knew i had
9858,is this only for americans or is it also happening to other people?
9859,Heckkkkk nawwwww.
9860,"Those distinguished and erudite individuals who, by virtue of their superior intellectual faculties, extensive education, and cultivated insight, have attained a level of understanding and discernment far surpassing the ordinary, enabling them to grasp the intricacies and nuances of the subject in question with unparalleled clarity:💀"

9862,"Wow, what a unique and interesting take on this situation. I certainly haven’t seen 80 different variations of this meme in the last day."
9863,Wait fr? Fuck yes I hate people

9866,I had to work through lockdown. I was SO jealous of the people who got to stay home for months. I would love to get another shot
9867,The first one didn’t feel so common
9868,Same I work as a plumber we had no days off shit was still going be finished on time
9869,Same

9872,WWS use ddPCR but interpreting concentration in wastewater to emergent infections is definitely still ongoing research (I'm writing my dissertation on it).
9873,Ha was more joking but thanks for the insight! Best of luck with the dissertation.
9874,What's your research question?
9875,"Oh, I was way in my head haha. I get it :D"
9876,"I'll post the papers when I publish, don't you worry."
9877,Nice!
9878,Thank you. My family was sick a month ago and now again this week. Everyone at work has gotten something. Thankfully schools is out for some reason.
9879,"While I don’t doubt a single thing you’re saying here, who can afford to stay home for 7 more days after probably already staying home a couple days during the worst of it?? That and children can’t miss that much school. Some of us are lucky to be able to work remotely as needed but I’d really be pushing it if I stayed away from the office that long. 

One of the Flu A strains just went through my household so I’m familiar with how awful it is. Somehow I was lucky enough not to get it. Fingers crossed the other strain doesn’t get us!"
9880,"I got the Flu B and let me tell you it was awful, still having a lingering cough"
9881,"I tested positive for Flu A 12/19/24 and finally felt 100% better about 3 weeks later. I woke up with a fever yesterday 2/7/25 of 102.2 and higher than what I had the first go around. The at home flu/covid combo was negative but the fever has reduced some and the symptoms are just a scratchy throat, headache, and fatigue. Hopefully if I did catch it a second time - it’s milder."
9882,Oh no :(. I was trying to find the answer to this same question earlier today. I was knocked onto my ass a month ago with Flu A and now everyone at my workplace has flu A....I was hoping I wouldn't be able to get it again but it's feeling like that's not the case :(.
9883,"Between this flu and the bad winter weather where I'm at (so schools closed), I am never going to catch up at work and I'm just going to be flying by the seat of my pants for the next month. 😭"
9884,What are the best ways to prevent getting this illness? Im immunodeficient so my last flu actually nearly killed me after having an 105° fever for four days straight.
9885,we just had flu b at my house. The local urgent care said we were the first Influenza B patients they have had all year. So definitely way less common.
9886,I never in my life got infected twice by the flu in the same season… i feel its rare
9887,"I had no idea about the 7 day thing, I waited 7 days just because I felt like crap, but I’m still symptomatic on day 13 so… 😳"
9888,1-week still sick!  Flu typ A. Went from dizzy chills feeling nauseous 🤢 to cold sweats high fever. And now in my 🫁 wheezing not a smoker. They got me on medication and still it’s hanging on! 
9889,Dr ordered Tami flu. I'm afraid to take it because of the black box warning
9890,"This might be a dumb question, but it’s one I thought of since this is the first I’ve heard that H1N1 is responsible for some cases of Flu A this year… I had H1N1 in 2009. Do I still have immunity? My daughter tested positive for Flu A on Tuesday and I’m still okay. Could that be why? (Also realize I’m not in the clear completely yet!)"
9891,I got flu A twice within a month from Jan-February and now I'm  dealing with Flu B. This is horeshit! I'm so over it. The first Flu A was bad and the 2nd I was completely shocked I had it again. Just had terrible sinus issues. And now back to feeling just as shitty with B. I might get the flu shot next year.
9892,"We’ve been hit with Flu A this year (not sure which one), and I really feel like it isn’t nearly as bad as last year. Last year’s had me begging Jesus to take me home. 😂😭"
9893,"Ugh I am so so sorry. If this post can even save *one* person from another infection this season, I’ll feel good about it lol but sadly some people are like okay! I got the flu so I’m protected this season… sadly no this year 🥲"
9894,"I totally hear you.. I just wish people would mask up if they have to return while still contagious, you know? That way you’re at least looking out for others. Sometimes though it seems people are either too prideful, or want others to join in on the misery and don’t care if they spread it around. 

Omg you are so lucky to not have gotten it!! I’m so jealous 😂 Stay safe!! I hope you have an easy remainder of the flu/cold season!"
9895,I'm still recovering from flu b.  42 female. Like day 15 from first symptom.  It was a solid 12 days before I could see the light at the end of the tunnel... still very much congested... so much pressure in my sinuses.  That was the sickest I've been in a LOOOONG TIME.  Slthw sore throat was INSANE... same the the pounding headache.. then it was days of fatigue and then on day 8 the gastro side hit.  Then felt wiped out for another couple days.  I'm terrified of getting flu a now 😭
9896,Ugh yeah I hear that one is also bad. I’m so sorry but glad to hear you’re overall doing better.
9897,"Damn I probably (rapid test all came back negative) have flu B now and it's so awful, and on me the worst part is the tommy symptoms came in the first, then you might have a low grade fever days after. So they treated me as stomach flu and made everything worse until I got a fever this Monday, and all the doctor thought my mental symptoms and random body aches (especially in chest and abdomen) was because my anxiety and all asked me to talk with my psychiatrist. Until this Monday I finally had a fever so I can finally be treated with Tamiflu, the first day on it, my tommy just became better and I can finally eat without pain.

FFS I kept telling them my body is in pain, especially in my legs and head, and lots of mood swing can't be treated with benzos and my Zoloft. All of my friends saw me and said ""You look like you're dying."". OF COURSE because I couldn't eat normally, couldn't sleep well, nightmares/SI everyday, lethargy and depressed everyday, suddenly allergy to a lot of food since the cold at the end of 2024, then the middle ear infection came after Norovirus in mid-Jan. ALL BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A FEVER SO NOT A SINGLE DOCTOR TEST FLU FOR ME, and I was just bad luck to kept having cold so I couldn't take the vaccine, I can only take ibuprofen for pain and fever now because I developed allergy reaction to acetaminophen for unknown reason, I visitied ER 5 times already this year, just hope anything will be all right from now on.

I really thanks the infection doctor that believed me I'm not a psychopath and gave me Tamiflu, and he's the only one told me that this year the rapid test for flu is only around 60% accuracy in my country, and why I couldn't be tested out with fever was the weather too cold or the wax in my ear that affected the measurement, later I measured with ectal temperature today and oh boy it was high LMAO."
9898,Ugh I am soo sorry to hear this 😭 I also hope it’s more mild and much shorter this go around!!! The only positive thing about this is.. you’ll have some great immunity against **both** strains for a few years!! Sending you lots of healing hugs. 🫶🏼🫶🏼
9899,"Again, it depends on the strain you had and what’s going around in your office! I hope you don’t get it.. might be a god does to mask up if you can? Youve got this. Sending good vibes your way. No one should have to get this twice. 🙏🏼🤍"
9900,Omg this. I have missed SO much work this quarter alone.. it’s so stressful!
9901,Im gonna get vaccinated even tho I already had flu A
9902,"Practice good hand washing hygiene. Wear a mask in public. Ask others around you to wear a mask. I’m sure you’ve already received your vaccine as most doctors suggest that if you’re immunocompromised. It’s important to note, while the vaccine can help ensure you don’t have serious complications from the flu, you can still catch it even while vaccinated. 

Please stay safe out there. This is a pretty gnarly bug this year. 🙏🏼🤍"
9903,"Totally, I think it’s still at like only 5% of cases in the US. Definitely more uncommon *right now*, but just as unpleasant 🥲

Experts also say Flu B tends to spike at the end of the season.. so please do be careful out there! (Although you should have immunity for that one, at least!)"
9904,"When did your last newest symptom start? The seven days start from there.. so if it’s been over a week since any new symptoms appear and you’re just dealing with residual congestion or a cough, you should generally be okay. Absolutely continue covering your nose and mouth when coughing/sneezing and wash your hands!! Hope you feel better soon. 🤍🤍"
9905,Ugh I’m so sorry to hear this. I hope you feel better soon!!! 🤍🤍
9906,"Yeah, the side effects can make it not worth it for some. Especially considering it only helps reduce symptoms by one day.. whatever you do, don’t take it on an empty stomach. I hear from many that it causes GI upset."
9907,"Absolutely not a dumb question… I’m not a doctor (just a chemistry nerd deeply intrigued by virology) so I don’t have a definite answer for you.. but a quick google search gave me this:

“Immunity from H1N1 influenza typically lasts for a couple of years, with antibody levels gradually declining over time, meaning you may need to get vaccinated again periodically to maintain protection; however, the exact duration can vary depending on individual immune response and the specific strain of H1N1 involved. 

**Key points about H1N1 immunity:**

**Short-term protection:**
After a natural infection or vaccination, initial immunity against H1N1 is strong but gradually wanes within a few years. 

**Flu strain variations:**
Because influenza viruses can mutate, immunity against one H1N1 strain might not fully protect against newer variants.”

I hope this helps 🙏🏼🤍"
9908,Omg I’m so sorry to hear this 😭😭 to catch all three strains is so unfair. I wish you a speedy recovery this time around!!! 🫶🏼🫶🏼
9909,"My son (17 years old) got flu A in late January, I got it too, he tested positive for flu B yesterday (only a month later) and I’m sure I’ll be getting it again too. We both got flu vaccines for this flu season but it didn’t work I guess..  
I’m just a little concerned about his immune system. Is it just bad luck??"
9910,"That’s great to hear!! And maybe because you had it last year?? Because boy, this sure has wiped a lot of people out this season, myself included!!"
9911,You too!
9912,Ugh am so sorry. This season has been so rough. I feel like it’s giving a lot of people a little PTSD for catching future flu illnesses! 😂🥲
9913,I also felt like that! It is so awful.  After finally feeling a little human again I get the gastro part.  And so exhausted.  And just out of it.
9914,"Dont take tamiflu, I did and I felt awful, the anxiety and depression and weird thoughts were crazy, check tiktok about tamiflu and how they get Su**cidial thought after taking it. And yes I had body aches as well especially from knee and bottom."
9915,"Thank you, friend!! It was a super rough 24 hours but I’ve got some energy today. December was a different story"
9916,Unfortunately I think I am already cooked :(. Woke up with a cough and am experiencing more fatigue as the day progresses.
9917,"Yeah this one felt crazy because it was like rolling new symptoms each day, but I would say by day 3 or 4 I was at the dry cough, no voice, low energy and have been there ever since. My boss is weird about working remote so I physically went in on day 9, but I have a private office and have limited interactions."
9918,Thank you. Prayer for everyone going through this.
9919,Same over here! This has wiped us out so bad
9920,"I think I spoke too soon! It’s taking its toll on my kids! It’s like a rollercoaster! But it’s definitely better for me. The fevers have been gone since day three, but the GI symptoms and body aches have stayed."
9921,Am I the only odd person that got gastro part first then the rest of other body part? It led me to have a wrong diagnosis for too long :(
9922,"No I don't have those symptoms, I only feel better, happier, less SI, only some insomnia after taking it. Everyone react differently to it, I know there are lots of ppl complaining about it, but my flu A a year ago was cured by Tamiflu too. I already took it for 3 days, only 4 pills left, everything is gonna be fine.

Also just a man from Taiwan who against China a lot, I don't watch tiktok, too many wrong informations in there. Also those who reacted bad to Tamiflu most likely to be teenager/elder, they'll get Relenza, or we can buy Xofluza without insurance but it's expensive.

Sometimes Asian react to meds differently than Western, something like Xyzal, most of us won't get sleepy or depressed on it, but Allegra oh damn it's completely opposite, gene is really fun :), and hope we can be better soon!"
9923,"Update:   
Sorry I take my words back, I almost finished myself from balcony without conscious after 8th pill, told my mom to tied me up and sent to ER, had an Ativan IV and just went back to home 12 hours later. The doctor said yeah there're some cases but rare...and seems your main flu symptoms are better now, just take ibuprofen if needed, it'll last about 5 more days, you'll be fine, next time if you have flu again, just go for Rapiacta or Xofluza."
9924,"Noooo 😭 I’m so sorry. I hope it’s nothing. And if it does end up being the flu again, I hope it’s more mild this time!!! 🙏🏼🤍🤍"
9925,I hate how we are literally forced to work while ill.. as if it won’t all still be there when we get back!!

9943,"This seems to be PTSD response from COVID pandemic. Although, seems like an overreaction. 

A virus outbreak with roots in China leads to fear among investors - if it snowballs into an actual pandemic like COVID, countries will come to a halt, global economic activity will be affected causing financial repercussions and eventually affect the stock market. Investors will want out and stock prices will tumble."
9944,Market works on emotions

9946,"Market runs on emotion and sentiments, anticipation of another Covid like condition can have severe impact on India due to the lackluster expenditure on public Healthcare evident from its budget of 1.9% whereas recommendations of 5% by NITI AAYOG."
9947,"These are speculations only, nobody declares why they are selling in large numbers. So might be some other reason"

Hopefully markets will correct upper circuit lgte rhenge buy low sell high"
9951,"A virus outbreak impacts the stock market because it creates uncertainty and fear among investors. When a virus spreads, people limit travel, avoid shopping, and delay business activities, which hurts company profits. For example:

Lower Sales: Businesses like airlines, hotels, and retail stores see fewer customers, reducing their earnings.

Supply Chain Disruption: Factories may shut down, delaying the production of goods.

Investor Panic: Fear of economic slowdown leads investors to sell stocks, causing market prices to drop.

This chain reaction makes the stock market unstable during such outbreaks."

10001,"Hold up because it isn't a pandemic yet, give it it's time"
10002,So it didn’t update at all this week?
10003,"Apparently? I'll check the NWSS datafile when it refreshes Friday night and post again if there's an update there. Technically it refreshes every night but I've noticed that our state's sewersheds tend to only update on Wednesdays and occasionally on Fridays, so fingers-crossed."
10004,Thanks!
10005,The only sewershed that updated tonight on NWSS is the same one that updated on Verily Wed. Plenty of other states had updates this week but not us.
10006,Odd. Thank you for the update!

10008,"Not only will I never take any mRNA jab, I no longer trust the medicines that I would have accepted in the past. Not because I have an issue with the science, but because I do not trust big pharma.

Sort of like, I still eat apples, I just don't accept them from psychopathic tyrants with a history of murder and betrayal."
10009,"The heart shaped hand sign whilst holding the vile is a bit of a hint..

Super cringe, but at least they’re subliminally warning everyone of myocarditis and pericarditis.

And, whoever is excited about lining up for another round of injectables for Xmas needs their neurosis checked out.."
10010,It's reassuring this one is also 'safe and effective'
10011,Thanks Santa ya cockhead but I’ll pass
10012,"So just like the flu shot, based on something that was around last year and lucky if it's 17% effective.

And always remember, Stage 3 and 4 cancer doesn't happen with no symptoms until suddenly there is."
10013,"how could it pave the way to tackling those when the covid jab couldn't even tackle covid? We're four years from the start of COVID and WA just brought back mask mandates and they're rolling out yet another covid jab here next month.

The only thing this will pave the way for is more pharmaceutical co profits, and making those costly mRNA factory investments pay off."
10014,Not having a covid vacinne is more safe and effective than having covid vaccine........bit of tongue twister
10015,No thanks I'm still jaded from the first one and their constant lying
10016,"Your government have already granted immunity to these vaccine companies. Selling vaccines is very safe and effective for making profits. And your government members will not need to vaccinate, either. Coronaviruses don't go to the politicians' workplaces for some reasons.

10017,"Remember to bypass the 'Apeel' apple/fruits, who the hell knows what Gates put in them."
10018,Yea reported by Paige Cockburn. Name says it all lol
10019,"Yes, pretty much everything in the shops is poisoned with chemicals or oil or soy (usually some combination of all). I pretty much just eat a carnivore diet but I also straight up moved to the 3rd world. I prefer to be responsible for my own life than to live in the pods. There is in fact a world outside of the control of the globohomo elite and many governments take the money from the WHO and just embezzle it. And the cops don't answer the phone when you call. Which to a city boy like me was a very weird experience I tried to call them and I am sure the NPCs reading this are losing their minds but I'm glad that the politicians are fat and uninterested instead of trying to micromanage my life and the cops are nowhere to be found. I assume they cash their government pay cheques and take naps. I wouldn't know, I've had zero interactions with them and I'm perfectly happy being responsible for my own safety."
10020,"I'm starting to stock emergency food/drink/fuel and supplies. 

hMPV is spread exactly like COVID - 19 and has the same precautions.

I will also be warehousing masks, sanitizers, face shields etc... their prices will go up in the next few months mark my words."
10021,Then we’ll get some more amazing audio dramas.
10022,People will cry about how their lives are being ruined because they can’t get drunk at bars or go to Disney World while their relatives and neighbors suffer and/or die. I’m not really convinced any real lessons were learned by the average Joe during COVID-19 so I fully anticipate the exact same dance to a newer song.
10023,"Anticipate much the same reaction with the new administration as COVID19. 

Slow reactions and lots of resistance to distancing, masks, and travel restrictions which will cause the spread in the US to be higher than comparable countries.

The new administration's resistance to vaccination standards will cost lives and similar results to COVID19 will be observed.

Blame will be heaped on China for letting it spread and moving too slowly and lack of adherence to safety rather than economical or social losses, which will likely cause even more foot dragging in the future.

HMPV tends to have lower mortality and transmission risk than COVID19. Unless it's determined to be much more lethal and catchable, the effect will overall be less, but handled similarly to how COVID19 was."
10024,More people would have to die for a proper lockdown to be finally called.
10025,"This is not a future what if, but a future when."
10026,"HMPV is a common seasonal virus, the situation in China does not appear to be particularly unusual. I would say with high confidence that there will be no major special actions taken regarding HMPV, either in China or elsewhere."
10027,With Trump in office lockdowns will never occur again.
10028,"Yeah, no shot we are locking down again. And, honestly, we shouldn’t. Locking down was entirely pointless with such silly virus like COVID. If it was Marburg or aerosolized Ebola, sure. But these are all super weak, lame viruses to shut the country down for."
10029,"Its not going to end well. People's mental health got truly fucked because of the lockdowns. I got the covid Vax and know it's real, but I don't want to be under lockdown for 3 or 4 months again. It's going to be one of those, go out if you want."
10030,I’ll probably just live my life normally and not get vaccinated just how I did for the last iteration of gain of function research that we funded
10031,My whole conservative side of the family is like this. They said they won't be listening to the government the next time.
10032,"It will be worse, even more people will ignore all advice and warnings"
10033,"Yeah, it would just be a Disney remake of the Covid lockdowns"
10034,I’d say lower that .05 mortality rate is not something to stock up on toilet paper about
10035,Isn't HMPV a seasonal virus that has existed for a long time? The last major paramedic was in 1918 before covid. I don't think anything is going to come out of this. The same old song and dance happened with monkeypox
10036,People were dying because of the virus especially in countries where the medical infrastructure was weak. The problem with humans is that we always underestimate natures tide.
10037,"Brother. Lockdowns were so that the cases would SLOW down and happen over a longer time period. 

Having 300 million infected all of a sudden in 2 months would fuck up any medical system in any country. Having 300 Million infected over 2-3 years would still do that, just not as much. 

And we need the hospitals to work cause OTHER diseases also exist, and they also kill."
10038,"I dunno if thats wise, but you do you my dude. Every pandemic needs some statistics I suppose."
10039,"The upcoming government is anti-vax and anti-mask

So... does that mean they'll mask up and get vaccinated?"
10040,I lived in Florida for Covid round 1 and people literally talked about being suicidal because Disney was closed. It felt unreal.
10041,"0.05 mortality would mean ~17,000,000 people dying in the US."
10042,"Eh, they will just shit themselves and blame the liberals. Same as they always do."
10043,"0.05 mortality rate would be one death in 20,000. So if one per 20,000 dies and the population of the US is about 335M then this would make total death 17,000 ish."
10044,"Plus, mortality doesn't include severe cases. And even more importantly, this will overwhelm hospitals and care systems, meaning OTHER diseases have an easier time. 

Remember, TB doesn't kill, it just fucks up your immune system so much that it can't do jackshit against the other respiratory diseases that come in"
10045,"Math, did you learn this at a woke university? Or a bougie high school degree, woke, unlike a practical ged and trade degree /s"
10046,"Add to that the impact of 17 million dying over a period of a few months, which would overwhelm hospitals, etc, leading to further ""excess deaths"" that would have been otherwise avoided."
10047,"https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ftsa&q=340000000*0.05%3D&ia=calculator

=17 million; it checks out."
10048,A lvls wasn't even cancelled in 2020 during COVID-19 what makes you think that they'll cancel it
10049,yes. a levels will never be cancelled
10050,"Firstly, A Levels won't be cancelled just because of a virus. O and A Levels still happened in 2020 in the middle of COVID.

Secondly and this can age rather poorly if I'm wrong, but chances of a pandemic coming out from this is smaller compared to COVID. HMPV has existed for a while, being discovered in 2001, and it's likely that it's part of the usual rise in respiratory diseases during the winter months. Though expect more cases of these cases becoming local outbreaks to be more common in the coming years with worsening climate change 

I highly suggest [reading](https://www.livemint.com/science/hmpv-outbreak-in-china-is-it-a-new-virus-how-is-it-similar-to-covid-19-is-there-any-vaccine-what-we-know-so-far-11736044379099.html) up on it to [ease your fears](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/human-metapneumovirus-hmpv)."

10088,"And then they're going to administer ""vaccines"" to the population because they think they're ""saving"" them, but don't you ever suggest that they're actually genociding their patients.

I hate people who simply cannot admit that their at fault, people who think that they're right all the time, those who are unable or unwilling to see the consequences of their actions.

Soulless freaks. simply cannot admit to doing anything bad. Both of them cannot apologize. They believe that they are doing good or right.

I would ask all of these globalist health officials, who appointed you are the ""judge"" or as the ""protector"" or ""caretaker"" of humanity. Claiming that you're doing it for ""their own good""? As if the people are fools who don't know any better, or can't take care of themselves, that they require you to insert yourselves into their lives.

Damn hypocrites. Even if you gently tell them that they're wrong, they just double down. Even if you were wrong, simply admit that you were wrong, and start to correct yourself, start fixing the mess that you've caused, how hard can it really be? Who does one have to be in order not to see that? Probably those who are without souls."

10090,"Oh no, not again! Seriously, I've had enough of this shit, I'm too ""old"" for this. Not another round of the plandemic game. Anything but that."
10091,"Well, I did say that this looks like distraction. I think the biggest events will be after late march, give or take a week or two. My intent is not to scare. Who knows if one of these predictions blows up to something real? If this kind of stuff helps at least one person then I'll post it in this sub where most people are open to it. I mean this place dedicated to one of the most horrific dreams ever. People here want to prepare for what's ahead."
10092,"It was during the plandemic that I realized that intention does not matter. Whether you intentionally wished people to die, or was misled, or just following orders, or thought that you did the right thing, it does not matter. Only maters what is the end result of all this, what is the impact upon a long enough time duration to make an observation."
10093,Is there fog in China? That might be the smog Beijing is infamous for.
10094,"We'll see if this picks up. There hasn't been another mention of it on r/PrepperIntel as of this writing. I'm counting on the Natashisoro/Clif High timeline because of the corroborating claims and they didn't mention a plandemic. But yeah they're only predictions for now. Who knows?

I will not waste our time with replying if this continues. If you could explain why I should stop posting and with what topics then I would seriously consider your explanation.

10124,what size did u get?
10125,i ordered around the same time and they just randomly showed up a couple days ago i never got any email updates lol
10126,They get more comfy the more you wear them for sure! Good purchase
10127,They are shipping out orders at random. Yeezy is in the A-leagues of being unorganized as hell

10131,Size 10

10134,dude you just won the hiatal hernia fix lottery
10135,"I had to have 3 adjustments for my stomach to “stay” but I also experienced profound relief almost a year ago now. I had one flare up in December following a respiratory infection and a single adjustment did the trick. Otherwise I am managing with occasional heel drops and breathing exercises. 

The only food I had to cut out permanently was caffeinated coffee (triggers a spasm that feels kinda like a panic attack, very unpleasant)

 Congrats on finding a knowledgeable chiropractor! In my area there is only one - and there’s a bunch of chiros where I live. 

Sometimes you may have to go back after long travel or a heavy cough, but it’s so worth it!"
10136,I'm so happy for you! Sounds like it's been quite the journey.
10137,Can you give us more detail on the adjustment technique? I’d like to try it…
10138,I’m going to try this tomorrow fingers crossed!
10139,Thanks for sharing your experience . How much % would you say that your back to normal?
10140,"As I sit here right now breathing for the first time in years without pain or discomfort, I am so grateful for this moment even if it doesn't last.  It is a mental mindfuck.  I just hope this helps someone.

Tomorrow I have a follow up with the doc about surgery, which I scheduled 5 days ago.  This could have taken a very different path.  I am so thankful."
10141,"I found this video that is almost exactly what I did.  Did it again today when I felt it moving again and works like a charm for me.

10142,Did it work??
10143,"I was totally back to normal... until this morning.  The hernia returned and I can feel it moving in and out of place.  Most frustrating thing ever.
That said, it's nowhere near as painful / uncomfortable as it was.

I'm likely going to have to get this surgery now.

Best of luck!"
10144,"As far as I’ve heard, any adjustments are only short lived. I hope yours lasts, but most have said it comes back."
10145,Didn’t do it today! Developed an ear infection which has been distracting me today. So will tackle later this week.
10146,"Health care in my country is a mess, i have to go on more holistic way. 

I belive i could pushed my down a week ago by doing belly breathing. I got so much relief that i could eat normaly again. But after two days i went for and endoscopy and show no hernia. Day after the endoscopy the symptoms start to come again, specially after too much sitting, but at this time i can eat at least. 

Best of luck for you too."
10147,"I spoke with my doc today and he said the same thing.  It could last a day, it could last a month, it may last 5 years.  The fact that it happened means it can happen again and most still need surgery. I am going to see how long this goes.  I think the part I'm most happy about is that this is proof that this is the source of my pain."

10153,"What went wrong with the previous pandemic was the lack of awareness and knowledge about the virus and the symptoms and especially the Media. The Media literally hyper it as the ' World ending virus ' which only bought two extreme reactions from the people. They either became too careful or too careful. Some would rush to the hospital even if they sneezed a little out of fear. Some would not wear a mask and didn't see a doctor even if their symptoms lasted for more than 3 days( out of fear of being quarantined).
I hope these things can be prevented and the govt stays on high alert."
10154,"Just a common cold due to f'd up weather, no need for concerns and from what I have seen, this virus has always been there, it's just that even though Chinese makes bad cheap products, they make excellent viruses!"

10156,"I'm going to go with the family gathering.  The plane is pretty ""air clean"" unless you were right next to someone who was a superspreader during the mask ""slip"".  The other biggeset place to catch COVID is being unmasked while boarding and deplaning.  I wore an Aura N95 on my last 2 flights to the west coast and I was fine.  But so were my two traveling buddies who wore no mask anywhere.  

Catching COVID is all a crapshoot, but some of the biggest spreader situations are family gatherings where people are with each other for hours, hugging, talking close for hours, etc.  My husband spent 7 days in the house with me when I had COVID and he never got it.  Several months later, he went to visit his father.  He and his siblings and their spouses all stayed in my father in law's house.  Unknown was that father-in-law had COVID (asymptomatic at first), and one by one each and everyone of them got sick about 4 days later.  What were they doing a lot of?  Sitting in the living room talking, talking, talking.  That's how it spreads--especially if someone exhales a lot of virus when they talk."
10157,Hard to tell where you got it from. i’d stay as isolated as possible though. My sis and husband both tested positive a day apart from me.
10158,"I’m so sorry you’re sick. I’d guess the family gathering. Were your parents there, too? I might just have your parents know how and where they might get Paxlovid if they do end up contracting it. For me, I have Kaiser and was able to request it online and have it picked up. I keep trying to get my elderly dad to have a pax plan if he gets sick. As hard as it is, you may end up surprised that they stay safe. Windows open is a good idea. Also if they have any air purifiers, run those. Mostly I’m sending you healing vibes. Do they have good masks there they can wear if they have to bring you food etc?"
10159,if you unmasked on a plane likelihood is you caught it there.
10160,"Everyone else might be ok. Covid is weird, it can hit multiple people at once or just one. In my house, we always got it one at a time and months after the person with it had recovered. 

There was a big family reunion last year with my boyfriends family. I was just out of quarantine, one of his sisters was out two weeks. At one point someone said one of the kids wasn't feeling well (he fell sick in the night), I went up to see what was up and said he probably had covid as his mum came upstairs. She was a little surprised and tested him, instant line on the test. Then his dad was like crap, I've been feeling really tired, takes a test, instant line as well. Neither had typical symptoms and I only knew the kid had it because I'd read something on here about a parents kids first symptom of that strain being an earache. The dad was just tired, that was his only symptom and he had been working long hours that week so it wasn't caught as covid. 

I hung out with the kid, let him play on my switch until they left for home. I was immune since I'd just had it. 

Now, the best part, no one else got it. There were 20+ people there, everyone mingling, kids playing etc and no one else got it. My boyfriends parents and his aunt and uncle were there and they were fine."
10161,"Thank you so much for your many points of comfort-- I still don't entirely understand who becomes + and who doesn't in an environment of exposure -- my uncle did test positive that night but thankfully the other 6 ppl there continue to be symptom-free, and a friend who I happened to be on my flight that day and sat next to me is also neg. 

Fingers crossed, so far the rest of my immediate household remains symptom free or negative, but I guess I'll be nervous for a few more days b/c of exposing them a bit my first day of symptoms. And my test line is still dark with a stuffy nose and dry throat :(. Here's to getting through this isolation."
10162,"Thank you for the isolation affirmation--closed my a/c vents, opening windows, and remaining in my room except to use the RR and masking to do so. It's pretty boring but so far my people are not exhibiting symptoms."
10163,"Thank you for your kindness. Yes, my parents and sibling were there! And that's a good idea--I now have a paxlovid plan for them. Kaiser really does make things super easy--I'm so glad you had that.

We don't have air purifiers here, but my sibling is holding it down with keeping the other part of the house's windows open, and I have mine. I closed my A/C vent jic that does something, and yes, they have KN95s, I am asking them to stay masked in my hallway for food delivery, but I'm not entirely sure they do so all the time :/"
10164,"When there was also a family gathering where OP unmasked for a much longer duration, and people there were later verified to have symptoms, that's the more likely source of contagion."
10165,"Thank you so much for sharing, and yes, wow, what a strange strange virus. I appreciated hearing about the different kinds of symptoms and exposures. I'm still worried but so far, everyone in this immediate household seems to be doing okay :( Similarly, in my uncle's house, he seems to have been the only one out of three, after the gathering."
10166,"Thanks, I'm beginning to think the family gathering is where I had my strongest exposure, especially as my uncle also tested positive. He took paxlovid, and is doing great now. I wonder sometimes about how I may have accumulated exposures at different points, but generally wish we were in a different timeline of social practices of safety with this pandemic--gah."
10167,"HMPV is not a new virus. It was identified in 2001and is a seasonal virus usually affecting children, older people and immunocompromised populations. This case could very well be a routine infection."
10168,"I don't find any non-Indian news website causing alarm about HPMV. 

Coronavirus was also nothing new either. But covid 19 was a big deal because it was 'novel' coronavirus. 

There is nothing novel about the current HPMV cases. For all you know, most of us here would have already gotten it by now."
10169,“No travel history” “Fully prepared to handle such emergencies “. Where have we heard this before. Hmm
10170,"As an infectious diseases physician in India, this is bull. HMPV has been already seen by many colleagues of mine across India, and this is certainly not new. What we do not know is

1. How common is it this year? We do not routinely test, and since COVID, testing is more common. So, bias is likely.
2. Is it more severe? Not enough data to say so.
3. Is this the same variant as in china? Cannot say. We do not have genomic data on any of the isolates so far.

As of now, no reason to panic, but certainly a need to monitor."
10171,It is not as severe as COVID which was a relatively newly discovered retrovirus. HMPV has been around for years.
10172,"Why is there so much news in India about HMPV? It's a regular seasonal virus. Its getting almost 0 coverage in US.

10173,"I just returned from my month long trip to China and HK, and honestly you won’t even know that there’s an “outbreak”. I traveled to 9 cities and there’s absolutely no panic or overwhelmed hospitals.

This is just Indian media trying to increase TRP. As someone pointed out above, this is not a new virus."
10174,"here’s a study from 2007 talking about how common hmpv is in young children: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1831873/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1831873/)

I am not sure how dangerous this variant of virus would be, but many variants of this have been present for long time."
10175,"This is all dumb panic: if you notice it’s only Indian news channels reporting on it, its not something the international media is covering (unlike say Covid)"

Probably because china is facing excessive cases"
10190,Can we find out how many cases of HMPV were found in India in 2023??

10214,"It was never a ""normal"" coronavirus. That's not how this works. When it was first detected, it was clear that it was a new pathogen"
10215,And HMPV is not a novel virus. That's what the other dude is saying.
10216,"And what I am saying is, In Nov, Dec 2019 and Jan 2020, it was just the seasonal flu/coronavirus in China, when in Feb/March everyone realized it was a new strain.

What prevents HMPV going the same route."
10217,"Covid was never a seasonal flu. From the early videos coming out from China, it was always named covid 19. Nobody termed it as a common flu. You can even check the WHO circulars"
10218,"The whole reason there was panic back in Jan 2020 was that this was a novel variant of Coronavirus. Otherwise, it was a non-news simply like the fact that half the people with runny noses in the country are affected by some kind of coronavirus only. Just like always"
10219,You real like being downvoted
10220,"I get that a lot of people might disagree with my stance on HMPV. Honestly, I have no hard feelings towards anyone who thinks differently. I hope the downvotes prove me wrong, and it turns into a story where I was just being overly cautious.

However, I believe that HMPV has the potential to become something much worse. Just like how the coronavirus was initially downplayed and then became a global issue, the same could happen with HMPV. In the next few weeks, we might see it turn into something completely new or a more infectious variant. 

I canceled a family trip to Italy in late February 2020, against everyone’s advice. It was a significant financial loss since most of the expenses were non-refundable, but we avoided a lot of trouble by not traveling.

Just yesterday, I booked another trip, and this morning, I realized I should have waited a few more days. Although it's not as costly, canceling these seven tickets is still an expense I am willing to bear. As before, I am okay with being proven wrong, but I prefer to avoid unnecessary risks based on my previous experiences."

However, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has detected only a few cases in India, and there is no unusual surge in infections. 2-3 cases in India.

10286,Be careful with this as your usual antibiotics don’t work. It’s also been detected in the US- southern region. People with underlying respiratory problems take note. Let your family and friends know right away.
10287,"This ain’t too bad. I had it last week. 

It basic flu like symptoms and that’s it. A few days of cough, cold, and fever - the symptoms were much milder than Covid."
10288,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world."

This is Mostly just china having a strangely high amount of it, overwhelming hospitals. Probably (?) just the regular fear mongering in the media."
10328,Hehe right now cases
10329,This did not age well

No need to worry "
10332,😅😅😅... Well said..
10333,clap cheeks ?
10334,"The media is no longer providing information for the audience to take decisions anymore, it's making information to manipulate the audience, majority of the news channels now speak jargon, which leads to illusory truth effects. Some media houses that showed the true spirit of journalism are either being bought by major corporations or the journalists that used to believe in morals and principles are being forced out of this industry."
10335,2020 and 2025 starts with WTF
10336,Pure gold
10337,"hilarious, considering the fact that even BRITIAN went into lockdown at that time"
10338,india went into national lockdown just 11 days later iirc.
10339,Didn't they said the same pre-covid!

because India has no resources to handle it, BJP did not learn anything from Covid"
10341,"No Cause For Alarm guys. We have thali, we have gomutra and we have Randas Athawale."
10342,“No Cause for Alarm”. Just keep a big aluminium plate and a ladle………just in case.
10343,"They said same thing before Covid. Then there was a huge Dolund Trump - Muddiji event following it.

Coincidence much or am I overthinking."
10344,"Umm..where have I heard that before. Oh wait, it was in 2020"
10345,Does anyone think the person who put out this statement has made some kind of assessments to back up this assertion?
10346,Dipping once in the Ganges at kumbh mela will kill all viruses is also something they said.
10347,Why bother learning when you are being praised for mediocre work done during Covid eh?
10348,What's the probability we will get into a lock down situation again in the next few months? 🤔
10349,Zero. It's a known flu virus
10350,"Relax, everyone.  If you’re old enough to be on Reddit, you’ve already had HMPV.  HMPV is thought to have spilled over from an unknown bird species between 200 and 400 years ago.  It is the third most common cause of viral pneumonia in children (7.5% of cases) behind rhinovirus (7.6%) and RSV (31-32%).  

This isn’t a novel virus.  It’s a seasonal virus, and if this year’s spike is slightly higher than in years past, it’s still not at a level that suggests anything like SARS-CoV-2."

Sounds like keep an eye out but business as usual?"
10352,Got my sim rig just set up and have plenty of toilet paper. Ready for this round.
10353,"Don't worry, y'all chose Trump to handle this again."
10354,*sighs*..I just can't go through this again.
10355,"This is just being alarmist. While it is seeing spikes in patients, it's similar to last years flu and other flu like spikes during winter. This would need a lot more development before regular people need to worry about."
10356,I had this a few weeks ago. Not to pleasant
10357,"Don't worry, we in the US are prepared for it this time as we're bringing back the D-team ... the plan this time will just be to ignore it and label it as fake news.




;)"
10358,I HAVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE
10359,Anyone else just like “here we go againnnn”
10360,I think it’s already circling its way around the US. It seems like everyone here in Missouri has it right now.
10361,"Whatever games you played during the pandemic, play them now. I have a feeling the competition will be cutthroat."
10362,"Ooo yeah!  Tiny hands and covid, and now bird flu.  Let see him extort states to kiss his ring or face no funding to manage the coming epidemic.  RFKjr get those bleach IVs ready."
10363,It is not Covid. It is a KNOWN virus. Isn't that a big difference?
10364,"Just in time for FelonPOTUS to create a new pandemic.

What's old is new again."
10365,Ya gotta scroll down way too far to find out that HMPV is **not** another acronym/ initialism representing His Majesty's «SomethingOrOther» -- like HMRC and such.
10366,I sure hope the Switch 2 is released in time for the next quarantine.
10367,"And so it begins again ,my country could have shut the borders quick as we an island .But they did not so we had covid here in record time this will be no different .Thousands will die again ."
10368,"China doing china things, who would've guessed a corrupt country with over population and no regulation on safety and health would be the breeding ground for viruses"
10369,"Ah, I’ve been missing the isolation and nonsensical rules like restaurants enforcing a mask policy until you’re seated."
10370,China will self-destruct either by population decline or virus.
10371,Shut borders to China.
10372,China about to transfer a few patients outside its country for “treatments.”
10373,"This and China would never admit they are overwhelmed IF this was serious. We all remember how much information came during covid out of China. Once the Information stops, I worry."
10374,Viral pneumonia is already going on in the USA.
10375,"Hasn't there already been a noted rise in walking pneumonia in kids this year? I know there has been in my area, PNW US."
10376,Buy all the toilet paper?
10377,"I definitely assumed rhino would’ve been like 30-40% as well, but glad to see that my gestalt that HMPV as the third most common pediatric respiratory pathogen is substantiated. I’ve honestly seen more HMPV than flu in recent years"
10378,"I don't follow. It's only 7.5% of cases, but you are certain anyone old enough to be on reddit has had it? Do you think everyone gets pnemonia 20 times before reddit age or am I misunderstanding something?"
10379,"> The symptoms of HMPV are similar to a cold or flu, and it is one of several viruses often lumped under a broad definition of the “common cold”, said Stephens. It is not a notifiable disease like Covid-19 or influenza.

Outside of the possibility that China is lying about the actual causes of rising illnesses, there is nothing much to worry about. This article should be downvoted for the misleading title."
10380,Buy a bidet - thank me later
10381,What we playing when it all pops off? I’ll be sitting in mine constantly if we lock down again.
10382,"He's about to go 2/2 on a biblical plague sweeping the planet after his election, but republicans will probably blame pronouns."

10388,"We’ve had one pandemic, yes. But what about second pandemic?"
10389,it's just the flu bro
10390,Will those developments take at least 1.5-2 months?
10391,American nurses aren’t doing another pandemic….you all will be on your own to keep yourselves and your families alive.
10392,"Yeah, having a modest supply of essentials like face masks, disinfectants and such would be recommended. I'm not suggesting going out and hoarding all that stuff but it's good to have just in case."
10393,"I honestly don't care if that happens, the problem is they take the whole world down too with them."
10394,"Yeah. Like when the Soviet TV reported on an impending war with NATO, you don't worry. It's when they play *Swan Lake* that you worry."
10395,What I remember about Covid is how much everyone tried to downplay it before the official stance changed to its really fucking bad. Originally only on fringe reddit and places was it being as bad as it ended up being Discussed.
10396,"If we see Taiwan warning about a pandemic, closing or tightening the border, and ramping up PPE, that's when we know it's serious. 

Taiwan's CDC has units that exclusively monitor for Chinese cover ups of public health hazards, which is why they reacted so decisively and early to Covid-19, with tremendous success."
10397,"Japan and Taiwan, their news stations reported symptoms of COVID in Wuhan since December ~~2018~~ 2019, but nobody took it seriously until it was too late.

Edit: Typo mistake on year."
10398,Or when the welding starts.
10399,The above average levels of pneumonia this season is walking pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumonia bacteria. It sucks.
10400,Rhino can cause pneumonia but less likely.  Usually just upper respiratory infection.
10401,Only a small percentage of people who are infected with HMPV get pneumonia.  The vast majority get a cold.
10402,"Like how Russia was reporting about a “mouse fever” on the frontlines, instead of reporting it for what it is - hantavirus?"
10403,"Good advice, already got one installed."
10404,"Got one with an instant on inline heater?

Where I live the cold water comes out of the Rocky Mountains.

Clench!!"
10405,You guys are worse than vegans.  We get it.  You found a new thing that you really like for right now.  Calm down.
10406,"Bold of you to assume they'll recognize the pandemic as real.

Even if they do, they'll probably push some other health quackery."
10407,"Lockdowns happened under Trump, and it's a state issue."
10408,Keep downvoting me idiot
10409,"**EDIT: Disregard what I said, they don't talk about overwhelmed hospitals.**

~~I don't know about that. Saw The Independent and later all the big Polish media write the same thing. The latter tend to use the Polish Press Agency as their source and PAP pretty much always tell the truth. I wonder where The Independent took the news from though.~~"
10410,[deleted]
10411,I don’t think he knows about second pandemic
10412,Broken clocks being right twice a day and all that. There’s fringe views on reddit for *everything*. If we believed .1% of them then we would all be living in bunkers. If aliens show up tomorrow some folks will be wondering why we didn’t listen to the internet UFO nutters more instead of the government.
10413,"Again, this isn’t a novel virus."
10414,"Taiwan wasn’t fast, they just didn’t believe the who hook line and sinker.  They took covid just as seriously as China did.  Like when China shut down a city of 11 million people, the who was still saying that everything was fine.

That was January 7th.   Taiwan doesn’t have better information than China does itself.  You see them do shit like, lock down a city with more people than nyc, you just gotta pay attention."
10415,Sure about the year?
10416,"Right, but are the vast majority of *colds* HMPV? That seems to be what you imply, but that should be said as the main point not just alluded to."
10417,On the Sim-rig?
10418,Refreshing in the worst possible way
10419,Sounds lovely
10420,Hugh? You got sand in your vgna?
10421,"Yes not a novel virus, though considering the impact that COVID has collectively had on the immune systems of the population, I think some concern is warranted since non-novel viruses and infections (ie RSV and pneumonia) have increased in the years since COVID. 

Ultimately COVID has been a Pandora’s box and we don’t have the luxury of not worrying about old viruses anymore."
10422,"I think it was a typo. It is incredibly unlikely that a virus like Coronavirus managed to stay inside a single city for a whole year.

The problem is either it's human transmissible or it's not. If it's not, having it all happen in a geographically small area is quite unlikely. If it is, it would have spread outside of the city much quicker."
10423,The majority are rhinovirus (~60%) and yet HMPV is common enough that just about everyone has been infected by age 10.
10424,Leave room for a peddling machine as well to burn a few calories
10425,We've got just the thing to help with that!
10426,"I don't think it is safe to say that non-COVID viruses have increased as compared to pre-COVID.  There isn't a good way to answer that question because the way we do so has changed.  And even if it has, I don't think we are back at an equilibrium just yet."
10427,Plausible if it was occasionally making the jump from animal to human but not able to spread human to human until the 2019 mutations.
10428,Exactly 🤣
10429,"This is so strange. People keep saying ""that's what they said before COVID"".  
  
But before COVID even came to Western countries, I have clear memory of doctors were telling us how we need to act and should be very concerned. People were disregarding the pleas of doctors telling us to be more careful.

This is the opposite of what happened during COVID."
10430,"This is exactly how a Zombie movie would start.

I keep hoping..."
10431,"Ding ding ding!  We have a winner for the phrase most often repeated by a government in 2025!  ""No reason to worry.""  Congrats humanity!  No reason to worry!

In all seriousness, I know HMPV is not novel or unusual in any way, and this uptick coincides with the yearly uptick.  Still funny anyone is concerned about causing a panic, after the last collective shrug at an actual pandemic."
10432,"I had HMPV in August. It’s worse than COVID, lots of deep coughing, hard to breathe deeply and I gave it to my whole family. It’s horrible. But I recovered after 2 months with no lasting effects. Time again? I would have tried to isolate more effectively."
10433,But like…travel is a concern and I know of Indian coworkers with family visiting right now so…
10434,I am somehow feeling like I have heard similar stories from few years back about different outbreak…
10435,"Panicking worsens things, and the misinformation can be interpreted in many ways. Still, we all can probably agree it helps to keep the vast majority of ignorant folks from getting out of control."
10436,The reduction of vaccines and access to healthcare will make this fun in the coming months for those of us that live in the United States with the incoming administration.
10437,No wonder 2025 started with the days W T F
10438,COVID was nothing there was no dead people. But people keep spreading miss info of people dying from other diseases.
10439,Who can you trust if not Indian officials?
10440,World was saying same thing about Covid-19 as well but seriously I hope its not really scary as Pandemic caused by Covid-19
10441,"I feel the same way hearing this that women feel when men tell them to “relax.”

I’ve seen this movie before. It was not great."
10442,"The reason experts keep saying it is not worrisome is because HMPV is not new, there has been human transmission for decades (Since 2001 really), and the current uptick does not, for now, look more serious than a bad flu season.


The ""not new"" part is more important than it sounds. Pandemics are usually caused by novel viruses: they are virtually unknown until suddenly exploding in cases. For example, COVID became a pandemic within a span of about 4 months after detection, which happened very shortly after the first animal-human transmission.

Experts are cautioning against panic, and these are the same experts that said COVID could reach pandemic levels back in 2019, so they are not some habitual deniers."
10443,Yeah the first Covid scares were SARS in 03ish and they were very concerned about both in China and out.
10444,"The initial response to COVID from most health authorities in the west was ""Theres no evidence of airborne transfer, just practice good hygeine by washing your hands frequently and sanitizing. Masking is not necessary""

I have no political dog in this fight, but that was absolutely the original position espouted in early 2020. People who were going out and buying masks and respirators were called paranoid. I remember being in a walmart and being one of the only people wearing an N95 and getting weird looks from people.

Soon after this, the advice from authorities switched, and soon there were mask mandates and some people who were previously in the ""paranoid"" crew suddenly were anti-mask entirely,  and the people who were calling them paranoid were now wearing masks and pretending they never made fun of others for wearing them."
10445,"back in the first week of january 2020 when we saw the first footage on reddit from china emerge and go viral, before it had arrived in europe yet - officials were calming the public down, saying it's not a big thing and we shouldn't be worried, heck china itself was misleading the public back then. it's also when the famous: it's just the flu, posts started on reddit from redditors.

one major issue that caused a huge shift in trust away from public officials, was their strategy to avoid a panic by misdirecting and misleading the public. famous example here in switzerland is when we were told masks weren't effective tools. (a statement that was made in the early days as there weren't enough masks and healthcare workers needed them first) - that strategy ultimately lead to a massive loss of trust in public officials, as everyone now understood that government officials weren't truthful, in order to avoid any form of panic to onset and to secure supply of critical resources. which begs the question: why should they be trusted going forward, if they don't trust the public to handle the truth."
10446,"Alarm started when covid arrived to Spain and Italy in mass cases that was like two or three weeks after Wuhan was a war zone and nobody gave af.

I remember entering into wuhan reddit every day seeing videos of people being taken from the streets while everybody screaming or authorities closing every residential building with chains and hospitals and sports center full of people or cars trying to get out of that city or the audio about a crematory saying they had 10x cases of deaths per day and it was increasing exponentially until they started blocking all the internet connections and nobody here knew nothing or there was any restriction nor health recommendation about it by then.

I even remember, like a week before it arrived in Spain that one guy at work tried to hug me and I moved away and he was, like ""you do strange things lately, are you ok?"" like I was mad xD"
10447,"I remember seeing a sign posted during covid. It said ""This plague sucks I wanted zombies""."
10448,Go wear your mask weirdo
10449,Did they actually  test you for it?
10450,"Nah, I feel there was panic from day 1 about covid.

I dint remember seeing one serious article that was like ""that virus thing in China? It's gonna be over in a week"""
10451,"Too early, we used to have around 8 years in-between outbreaks"
10452,"I was thinking the same, what a coincidence 😅😅"
10453,"If you had bothered to read the article, you would know that it's not the Indian officials who said there is nothing to worry about."
10454,India handled the pandemic better than a lot of western countries.
10455,For some reason hearing China and India tell the rest of the world “don’t worry about it” is making me REAAAAALLLLLLLLLYYYYYYY worry about it.
10456,"Right?!


Third world nations that sends millions of immigrants to the west each year gets a new contagious disease?


Nothing to worry about here."
10457,Thit hit me when you say 'decades' referring to 2001....damn I'm getting old haha!
10458,"My only gripe with the history of COVID is the belief we found and reported the first cases ever of a novel virus in Wuhan, China.

I think it's completely ridiculous to believe when an unknown respiratory illness was spreading through the US killing people who used vapes 6 months prior.

I also starkly remember multiple manufacturers telling me a flu had taken out their entire production team, in September 2019. Wuhan didn't happen until December 2019.

Wuhan, imo, was simply the first place a doctor finally decided to research and culture the virus."
10459,"The worst of it is that they were not wrong. The public cannot be trusted to handle the truth, just look at what happened to toilet paper when shit hit the fan.

It sucked that they had to lie, but the priority, like you said, is securing critical resources and trying to maintain order, as is usually the priority in any kind of emergency."
10460,"Sounds like a movie.
I wonder what would the us or some country in eu do if it started there instead.
Like would they act differently and would it spread out or not."
10461,"Yes, it's part of a pneumonia panel test we do in hospitals when you're admitted. It's been around in US since last summer?"
10462,There was about a month of questionable stuff happening in China before it got taken seriously. Helped that Covid was really quick in spreading to West.
10463,"In September of 2019, when it was first noted?  No, there was absolutely no panic or worldwide concern about a few cases of SARS in China.  We, the citizenry, absolutely expected nothing of this in our area until like Jan or Feb 2020."
10464,"You drop dead from the Alpha virus and they tried to hide it till too many were dropping dead that it is causing a panic already


Edit: How are you all forgetting how many died. It's only been four, five years!"
10465,"covid 2019 started in well….. you guessed it. 2019. duuuuh

but was there anyone who even heard about it in 2019?

It was 2020 we started hearing about it, barely january. It was almost in february that it became serious news."
10466,"Have some family member who are doctors. They mentioned some papers suggesting that due to global warming virus and bacteria pathogens have longer active periods, so they are mutating faster leading to higher rates of infection."
10467,"People here will say negative things about India over anything be it space missions, fake news,etc. But try to critize America over anything like their history of foreign interference and suddenly there will be rabid replies about how you can't call America bad"
10468,"Uh, do you remember the Delta wave, where they just piled up the bodies on the streets in front of hospitals, because they couldn't handle the amount of people dying?"
10469,"well its opposite , billion population containing countries having only 3 -4 cases , u should be happy about it ?"
10470,My bet would be that this was designed virus being studied that somehow got out of containment in China.  That is just my opinion based on what I have seen and read in some of medical journals the last couple of years
10471,"Army of NPCs downvoting. Tons of people I know were getting sick with unexplained respiratory illnesses, coming back negative for everything. Just cause we hadn’t identified it yet doesn’t mean it hadn’t already spread"
10472,"It would have been the same, in fact China probably contained the thing a little more, because even their cities population are like an entire country here, they could do authoritarian measures from the start, like dragging people down to the hospital if found with symptoms.

I remember reading from back then, that they did mandatory in house even worst than us, because officer from gov went door by door to give food and measure fever or coughing, if somebody had symptoms they were forced to go to hospital."
10473,"There was a bad response happening, yes. And the Chinese authoritarian government was being itself. 

But the media wasn't known for downplaying covid, quite the opposite"
10474,I was looking for FFP2 masks on Amazon in December 2019 due to the cases around the fresh meat market. nobody sold any.
10475,"What? I don't remember that happening. Even in European countries like Greece had Bodies on the street wrapped up in Paper. Try to be Racist better if that's what you're trying lol. But if it's a serious question, no, I do not remember that happening."
10476,lol. If you believe their bullshit.
10477,"It's okay, upvotes and down votes are simply a reflection of collective opinion and not necessarily a representation of fact.

Today we still have large groups of COVID deniers, people who want to believe China is the source of all evil, and blind following of authority figures. Any contrarian will be down voted.

If reddit existed pre-Aristotle, you'd be down voted everywhere for claiming the earth is round."
10478,Same i live in America and since new year we have been missing half the staff. At first I thought people just didn't want to work and then I was told by them that they really was sick. I spoke to one person who said they don't usually get sick but felt flu and respiratory problems. They went to emergency room and it was pack. I told her about hmpv and she fits the symptoms.
10479,"They totally downplayed it, even when chinese bought masks in every western country to send it to china or when they build a hospital in a couple of days, western media kept saying like that was overreaction and we would be completely safe until the outbreak in Italy and Spain that made it clear that was already a global thing, then sure, they did everything and more but there was 3-4 weeks were health ministers were saying everything was under control and nobody should worry at all."
10480,"You are remembering incorrectly.

They absolutely downplayed it, discouraged wearing masks and siting the WHO stating there was ""zero evidence of airborne transmission"" and that washing your hands and sanitizing surfaces would suffice.

Many people were mocked and called paranoid for wearing masks in those early days, myself included. Then suddenly everyone else was doing the same, and conveniently acted like they never downplayed it and called others paranoid."
10481,"my point is, whether this is serious or not, if it keeps showing up in the news, it’s good to be considered as worrisome enough. So best to buckle up"
10482,Was hoping for another pandemic so I’d have an excuse to stay home all day 😥
10483,This has been recognised as a cold with a little cough and sneezing and I runny nose nothing to worry about
10484,No need to fear too much. It's old virus. Just we need to be more careful
10485,Media has to make people freak out for clicks. 
10486,"Just so but what I want to know is if this is a new strain that is more easily spreadable. Coz that will make this a pandemic faster, even though the virus is not lethal"
10487,"This is only partially true. If you’ve had it before—ya, the symptoms are usually mild and it’s cold like.

But if you haven’t, then the first go around can be pretty rough, mainly in kids."
10488,Wait what? HMV is an old extremely contagious virus that's been with us for ages.  How is this possibly the first case in india?
10489,I would be asking yourself WHY a common respiratory virus that already exists seasonally is continuing to be reported in headlines like the next big pandemic.
10490,"HMPV circulates every single year.

Peak marketing scheme though.  Ride the fears of COVID to something that's been around from decades and capitalize on peoples fear.  There is just so much money to be made on fear, from giving places like CBS clicks and ad revenue to food and PPE sales.

If you are worried about seasonal illness that have been around for decades or centuries, take the hint that, if at all possible, you do what you can to get healthier."
10491,I’m actually all for another period of sitting in my house and being paid to do so. Bring it on
10492,Boy haven't we heard that official statement as nauseum just not long ago?
10493,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

10494,"Here's a preview of the story: 

Indian officials have confirmed the vast nation's first cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with seven people said to have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.

10555,Actually my boss got sick returning form Shanghai last week and it is HMPV
10556,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world."

Also install 50cm high plastic barriers between all dining tables immediately. Stupid Western countries who dont do this will have MILLIONS of deaths!
10564,Yes this is seasonal as it does spread more in colder months. But this is a larger spike in cases than what is expected in terms of data from previous years which has been picked up on. Although this spike is still in the range where it isn't considered an outlier in cases and is believed by experts to be in the normal range at the moment. Unlike Corona virus this is not a novel virus. This means most people have some sort of immunity to it. Obviously everyone should try and stay hygienic by washing hands often and staying inside when sick as nobody likes getting ill.

>Most people who caught it probably didn’t even know they had it, however. Sick people aren’t usually tested for it outside of a hospital or ER.

I was in China during 2001 as well when SARS broke out, it was pretty damn awful down south yet in the news paper you saw nothing about it. Fast forward in case you missed Covid, another neat clusterfuck that lasted 3 years actively and even today is being played off what truly happened.

So people being concerned and/or questioning what's going on is pretty understandable. Certainly after China let Covid go global causing millions of deaths without notice while having plenty of data on hands, and if countries questioned what went on they faced economical and political retaliation.

Sure, but why is it a cause for concern when it’s reported in China when the virus has been circulating in the population for at least 2 decades since identification but possibly even longer?

Is it extra scrutiny or prejudice?

There was a recent warning here in the U.S. about increase infection of RSV especially among children.  There was a spike in RSV cases but it barely made the rounds online.

Why such huge discrepancies in alert when multiple variants of RSV exists and is a common infection like HMPV?

>HPMV is not a non-issue

No infection is a non-issue as there is always a chance of complications.  RSV is not nor is the flu.  It is though very common as most people might have already caught it and most people that do catch it include children will experience a cold.

However there is an usual amount of concern and biased assumptions both in comment, posting and media when conclusions from actual health experts seems to be regular seasonal occurrence"

10716,"Yep they can do their own research. 

However, if you fail to see why people might be nervous about being told “there’s a virus circulating in China but it’s nothing to worry about” then maybe you are underestimating the trauma that covid caused."
10717,"If you're going to be elevating this to the level of actual scientific nomenclature I'll have to correct you. This isn't intended as a ""gotcha"", but it feels like you're presenting yourself as more of an authority on the subject right now rather than just some guy in a mud slinging match online so it's important to get it right.

COVID is an abbreviation for **CO**rona**VI**rus **D**isease. It is not a genus and has nothing to do with scientific nomenclature. It was a convenient name to use so people didn't keep panicking whenever the acronym SARS came up. COVID-19 was caused by *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* (so the genus is *Betacoronavirus*), which is the same species which caused SARS in 2001.

Forcing us to get all scientific here rams the point home. *Human metapneumovirus* is a species isolated in 2001. *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* is a species which caused an epidemic in 2001. Yes, they both already have existed in humans for some time, that doesn't mean new variants don't appear (as the new variant which caused COVID-19 suddenly appeared). Nobody is saying it has, or will, but aren't we being a bit obtuse to pretend there's nothing familiar about a species of virus from 2001 suddenly spreading out of control in China after we JUST got over a pandemic caused by another species of virus from 2001 spreading out of control in China?

It’s not if but when this current variant of bird flu will jump species while research of HMPV would reveal that it’s a common seasonal infection right behind RSV."

10737,">it’s more like calling a Golden a German

No it’s not.

HMPV is a single stranded RNA virus while Influenza is a single stranded segmented RNA virus.

The segmentation in influenza is what gives it high evolution and mutational rate.

Influenza also produces unique hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin-esterase fusion that’s uniquely influenza and not found in HMPV.

They are all viruses but they are vastly different, appear different and have different genetics.

A flu is specifically caused by influenza and no other virus"
10738,">google released lab Wuhan

Sure, none of which is peer reviewed and gathered in a scientific practice.  Google US lab release and you can find articles of allegations of US releasing the virus.  

>are you suggesting it’s a coincidence a lab

The U.S. CDC is founded in Florida because the scientists want to go to south beach.

CDC was founded in Florida because it was the epicenter of malaria and other tropical borne diseases so it would be easier for the CDC to collect samples and deploy remedies.

If your lab research is about ice caps, you don’t build your lab in the middle of a desert.  If your lab is about emerging zoonotic infections, you build your lab where there has been historical high occurrence of such outbreak.  

Just because a lab is built doesn’t mean we can predict and control all new cross species outbreaks.  No one can tell when a novel microbes is going to jump species and start infecting humans."

So if Asian Americans mask up as a precautionary measure (even while they are not sick), other Americans just think they’re sick.

I've lost count the amount of times I've seen kids defecate on the sidewalk, boys and girls."
10833,It is unique to China. Lack of basic hygiene knowledge leading to serious diseases and pandemic.
10834,Asian Americans are generally well educated. In Asia it’s a huge mix of education levels. I keep getting back to the fundamental lack of soap in public places in China. That can’t be good. Most the time it appears either not installed (who knows where it’s going) or simply stolen as is any attempt at public toilet paper. Also the level of education in Asia varies massively. Workers coming in from the countryside and have no Hukou in Beijing for example (yet work there) make up about 20% of the population and often lack the education you describe

News reports and social media posts are warning of a new outbreak of a little-known virus called human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China, but officials are yet to confirm this.

Instead, official reports from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that rates of multiple flu-like illnesses are on the rise in China, according to data up to the last week of 2024.

They're all similar, in that they're all viruses that infect us, but they are all very distinct. If we were talking about different animals with a similar spread of classification, coronavirus would be a squid, influenza would be a snake, and HMPV would be a wolf.

>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.

>The estimated incubation period is 3 to 6 days, and the median duration of illness can vary depending upon severity but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses.

10891,"hMPV like many viruses is particularly harmful in the young, elderly, immunocompromised, and those with preexisting conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart failure, CF, etc. There are also the occasional ""normal, healthy"" people who go down like a ton of bricks. For the remainder of healthy folks they weather it with some misery but otherwise ok."
10892,"A colleague is a big hMPV person, research wise. I asked them what the deal with China is.   Their response was that 1) hMPV does this. Like RSV and other respiratory viruses they come in waves every few years.   2) Since COVID there is increased testing  capacity, reporting requirements and capacity and overall concern and awareness of respiratory viruses.  3)hMPV is a well known cause of LRTI so puts people in hospitals.

Nothing to see here."
10893,"There is nothing unusual about this. HMPV is a seasonal illness. Most people handle it fine. A small number of people get seriously ill. There is no data suggesting that the current spread is more than normal.

My theory is that the social media furor is being driven by [Trump’s well-documented search for a disease to justify closing the border](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/trump-title-42-migrants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)"

10895,"one of our pts yd was hospitalized last week for AHRF 2/2 to hMPV

outpt attending never heard of it haha"
10896,I wasn’t young elderly or immunocompromised and I ended up with bacterial pneumonia from HMPV
10897,"Anecdotally I was a resident during the 21/22 winter and we had probably a couple dozen cases of hmpv needing hospitalization for supportive care, mostly cardiac babies and the like. Hadn’t seen or heard much of it since then until now."
10898,I’m working in China and we’ve seen more influenza and enterovirus in our weekly surveys. A surprising amount of GABS too. In the weekly Chinese CDC report HMPV is always near the top of the most frequent diseases but TB is also in that top ten list. It’s nothing like the crazy hexademic we had last year when the COVID opening happened.
10899,Coronavirus was just a “common cold” virus before Covid came around too
10900,"""Just a common cold virus."" That common cold virus by itself put someone in their early 40's in my household in the hospital for more than a week, gasping for breath and having to be put on nebs etc. They couldn't do anything. Labs were all out of whack. And nothing pre-existing except asthma so mild it was not necessary to treat it before this. 

She was tested for everything under the sun, and nothing was positive but hMPV. I honestly feel that not enough caution is given to what were routine viral infections before, to now since Covid has hit multiple times. Up to date on all vaccines, and it wrecked her."
10901,Not sure why you think this is relevant. SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen. This is not.
10902,"True but SARS and MERS were more in the realm than the common cold was when considering coronaviruses in general imo. But for sure, mutations can occur in “common” viruses and have. Thanks for pointing that out."
10903,[deleted]
10904,"it's not just hmpv. this year has been especially bad with the flu, rhino, parainfluenza, rsv. really all the colds have been kicking butts of anyone with any kind of obstructive airways disease. I know because I have about 13 on my consult list and 3 or 4 have been needing much more aggressive treatments than usual in terms of steroids and nebs that are typically used for exacerbations."
10905,Wow then I apologize for downplaying it. Perhaps there have been mutations that have made it more virulent? That’s for sure true of RSV lately.
10906,"It’s a mutated coronavirus, not novel."
10907,Yes very true re sars/mers
10908,"If I had access to the labs done at the time, I would share that information. Her labs were really off, as was described to us, they did cultures to see if there was a co-infection (there wasnt), and before the cultures came back they threw everything they could at her, including iv vanc. She was on maxed steroids a few days in a row, she was on round the clock neb treatments almost the whole time. So a ""known asthma history"" where in fact she never even needed an inhaler previous to hospitalization doesnt seem routine. 

The doctors didnt exaxtly know why things progressed as they did. Everything was clear but hMPV. And yeah, ""all out of whack"" was essentially the one descriptor that came to mind."
10909,"My question is, do you feel that this is an extension of covid exposure? There was evidence that covid after repeated exposure could cause harm to the immune system, including B Cells. That was a big difference in the household. She was exposed and caught covid probably 4 times, and at least once was before vaccination and it hit her hard. 

While not conclusive, I feel its something to be cautious of going forward for providers as evidence shows altered immune response in long covid patients as well. Even those with asymptomatic covid infections."
10910,It’s been bad enough that I’ve been pondering if it’s happening because I’m getting older. Am I circling back around to my childhood of colds kicking me right in the bronchioles? Every cold I’ve had since covid has been terrible!
10911,"There are reports that a mutation is allowing it to get deeper into the lungs, causing pneumonia that the body can't handle. I apologize if I came off a little rude or curt. The experience was harrowing to say the least. She was sick with it for a week before going into the hospital, and they gave every therapeutic intervention they could to try and get her system to recover. She luckily is now out, but on several meds for worsened and complicated asthma now. 

I feel that because hMPV is ""related"" to RSV in a way, its worth keeping an eye on as it progresses."
10912,that's hard to say. my theory is that these other viruses havr been on the backbrner and people haven't been having exposure to them yearly like before covid  so now it's almost like a brand new virus with an exaggerated immune response.

10915,"If you’re poor enough to not be insured your daughter will almost certainly qualify for emergency Medicaid which will cover the entire visit including urgent care and hospitalization. 

I would like to clarify as well that an O2 sat of 82% and Lower Lobe pneumonia is not a garden variety flu, it’s a respiratory infection that, without treatment, has a very real possibility of killing your child in the next day or two.  Whatever the cost, you’ve gotta pay - she can not be without oxygen and monitoring for any length of time right now, at any time she could tire out, have a respiratory arrest, and die. 

I can’t overstate this enough, she needs treatment."
10916,"We are seeing very sick children right now with pneumonia on top of flu. It is bad, bad, bad across the country.

The triad of low oxygen plus fast respiratory rate plus fatigue/increased work of breathing is what comes before they drop off that cliff. Unfortunately, kids are NOT adults; they exhaust their reserve without many signs that the collapse is immanent. You can't wait until they ""look worse."" This is what they look like when they are in crisis.

Please let them take her to the hospital in the ambulance. Honestly, although triage shouldn't work this way, it may make it even an inch more likely to get the last bed there. The last night I was on call, I spent the next day pulling together the direct line numbers for ""transfer centers"" (or the equivalent) for children's hospitals in the surrounding seven states.

I'd had to call four children's hospitals before I could find one for transfer. Well, one of them would have taken her, but there was a 24 hour wait expected -- and we don't have kid-sized ventilators here. The last time I saw one like this, we did intubate and just tried our best while awaiting transport.

Children's hospitals are in crisis. This is our version of the 2019 surge. RSV and flu are hitting hard, and COVID is still there, but it's the secondary pneumonias that are doing them in. Check out the nursing subreddit. Nurses without experience in pediatrics are being pulled in, including to NICUs and PICUs.

The hospital will work with you. There is some specific language to use when asking for aid if you are in that hole between Medicaid and being able to pay. We will help you. Please get her safe.

Edited to add: So very sorry you and she are having to deal with this. It is hard. It is awful to have to choose."
10917,"I’m sorry this is happening to your daughter.

There is no safe option other than the ambulance ride with the oxygen mask.

Speak with the hospital social worker while she is admitted. If you are under a certain income level, it is likely that your daughter will qualify for a state-funded children’s health care plan. If she qualifies, this will be retroactive to the care she is about to receive, since she qualified all along.

If not, ask about applying for charity care/bill forgiveness through the hospital. This option will take perseverance, but there are organizations that can help you advocate for yourself if you get a bill that seems unfair.

Good luck."
10918,"It really makes me sad when cost is a financial barrier to healthcare – I’m sorry to hear your daughter is sick and that the costs are already adding up

An oxygen saturation of 82% is very low, normally we want it in a young healthy child to be at least 97%, ideally higher. Hypoxemia can cause considerable damage to many parts of the body. If she needs to be on an oxygen mask (beyond even nasal prongs) to keep her oxygen levels at normal range, that’s quite serious (even if you feel your daughter currently doesn’t physically appear to look that sick). This is not something that should be managed at an urgent care centre"
10919,I hope your little one gets better!!
10920,So glad to hear she’s doing better. Sounds like her mommy is pretty strong too.
10921,"The wroding the UC used that you ""must"" do XYZ is incorrect. You have the option of driving your child to the hospital yourself but you'll be taking the risk. The chance that your child will get super sick with you taking her or an ambulance taking her is low. 

As for whether you need to go to the hospital, that's harder to know without seeing the child. Statistically most transfers of such sort are to prevent you from suiting the doctor afterward when shit goes wrong. And yes, people sue their doctors when we don't take every possible last resort to prevent something even remotely from happening. 

If my child can maintain her oxygen and stay hydrated at home and there is no signs of sepsis then I would take my child home and if something goes wrong I would go follow up with a good pediatrician or go back to the urgent care or walk into an ER."
10922,"Thank you for pointing this out. NAD but OP, my college friends and I are in mourning today because we lost our lovely, healthy 42 year old friend last night to pneumonia complications from Flu. She went from fine on Tuesday to intubated on life support by Thursday. Please listens to the doctors. Have her transferred however they think is most likely to keep her comfortable and more importantly, safe. Im sorry insurance is an issue for you here. I see lots of other great comments helping on that issue."
10923,"Thank you for the info. Some of this I did not realize until it was almost too late. I truly thought she just had the flu. I’m so glad I decided to bring her to urgent care. Now I know what signs to watch for in the future and to take action vs waiting it out a little. That can be the difference between life and death. I feel so guilty that I didn’t bring her in sooner, but I’m just thankful she’s going to be okay and she’s in great care.

Are you able to elaborate a little on the language I should use when I ask for aid? I’ve heard this elsewhere too that they won’t offer it, you have to specifically ask."
10924,"What a sweet spirit you have. I’d wager a limb that you’re an excellent doctor, driven by an actual desire to fix all the boo-boos. 

Thank you for the clear language and for sounding the alarm (and for likely working too long & hard at times like this). I had no idea about the crisis, but I’ll spread the word now.

Hang in there. You are needed and appreciated."
10925,"One of my doctors offices is inside a hospital building and they are not letting kids inside to visit and they are screening people coming in for signs of illness. 

I know so many*adults* who have picked up illnesses from kids already this year and yes that's usually normal but it's usually minor colds and these are 1-3 week long knock out drag out fights of illnesses. 

RSV and the flu are kicking hospitals asses. They need to get back out there and start telling people if you feel sick stay home and if you need to go out wear a mask (because people feel like they don't need to anymore because they are covid vaccinated) 

And I know we are all sick of covid but if there's anywhere that is dealing with this and gets a really bad surge this winter it's going to be an absolute catastrophe. 

I don't say that to be a doomer, I say that because I can see the large and very well staffed urgent care and hospital times around me being crazy during slow times for example. I can see the measures my hospitals are putting into place. 

This is my first large Thanksgiving dinner in a couple years (none other than my husband in 2020, like 5 people 2021). I don't want to not be able to have a Christmas dinner this year, so I'm certainly not doomering it. I wish there was more out there as far as PSAs"
10926,"Why is it that we are seeing such high rates of rsv and flu? Is this only in children or also adults? Is it that there are many more infected, or are the symptoms/the virus worse/stronger than in previous years and it makes them more sick?"
10927,"I’ll add that I’m a medical coder and part of what I do is assist patients with high medical bills and attempt to get them written off or reduced. 

Op, it’s likely you can get those Medicals waived or reduced. Medicaid usually has a 90 day retroactive look back on claims. Most people on unemployment also are usually eligible for snap as well. With the federal boosters in place, that might also give you some breathing room as well."
10928,"At the hospital, your daughter may qualify for Medicaid, and there should be a person who can help with the application. I can’t speak for TX, but the 2 states I’ve worked in, Medicaid is retroactive to the beginning of the month, so if she qualifies, the hospital stay and the urgent care visit will be covered. I don’t want to get your hopes up, but I do want you to know that hospitals work with uninsured people every day and there are people employed by the hospital to help you with this."
10929,"The following is not my comment but I saw it elsewhere on Reddit today. Sorry, I don’t have the redditor’s name. 

Hey sweetie I negotiate hospital bills for a living. I want to let you know that what you’re feeling is normal, but only because people don’t understand how not serious this is. So take a few deep breaths and let me explain…

Insurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf. We frequently gets these bills reduced by 40, 50, 60%. This has caused providers to pad their bills, knowing they will only receive a small portion. That, plus all the uninsured folks who never pay, means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic services.

You do not have to pay this bill. Ever. They can’t do anything to you. No one will force you. It will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt. This is America. Literally everyone has medical debt. It won’t stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house. It doesn’t make a difference.

In a few years, the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar. Then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times, trying to settle with you. At this point, if you want to settle, offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full. They will likely take it.

If you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you’re making the payments, it won’t get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).

Please don’t do anything drastic. The system is fucked and it’s supposed to make you scared and nervous so that you sell your baby to pay the bills. In the end, the hospital knows they have no leverage against you so they want to make everything complicated and intimidating. Don’t let them win. You got this."
10930,"Not OP, but can I ask a related question? My son is 3.5yo and has asthma. He usually sits about 98% when healthy and not having an asthma flare. When he's sick, without an active asthma attack he generally ranges 94% but has dropped as low as 87%. We've been told to take him to the emergency room when he drops to 89% or lower... but is it safe for him to be 90-93% staying home in bed whenever he's sick? Because as of right now, that's currently what's happening."
10931,">It really makes me sad when cost is a financial barrier to healthcare

Even more so when it's access for a child. A child is not responsible for their parents ability to pay insurance."
10932,My mom got hypoxemia from pneumonia I never understood what happened to her she was 80 😭
10933,"I was an EMT and a pre-med student one semester from my degree before my body finally tried to give up on me. I wanted to be a doctor so badly but I never understood the cost of healthcare in the US until I was on the other side. 

Starting when I was 17 and continuing throughout the entirety of college I had pyelonephritis over and over again, multiple instances of sepsis, kidney failure you name it. In my entire life I have never been uninsured and never had lower than “gold” level “amazing insurance”. 

My accountant friend sat down with me and we got to $2 million dollars before we gave up adding the rest of the medical bills. I can’t even file for bankruptcy because there would be no point because it’s not something that will go away. 

And this is with me being insured…I can’t even imagine someone in a similar situation without insurance. 

It’s so wrong that people like OP even have to be worried about the financial cost of healthcare."
10934,"Thank you ❤️ she is, slowly but surely."
10935,Thank you ❤️ We are almost through it!
10936,"Read the post more carefully, this is not a case where we can do some equivocating on the internet.

If this parent took the uncertainty in your response to heart and chose to take them home, there's a good chance the kid would die or be even sicker when they end up having to go to the hospital. Your colleagues in the urgent care HAVE seen her and want her transferred, that should be enough for you to wholeheartedly endorse the necessity of a transfer for a kid with an O2 sat of 82% on room air."
10937,The kids room air SpO2 was 82%. I’m no pediatrician but that seems like a slam dunk hospitalization to me.
10938,"Rapid respiratory rate with a pulse oximetry on room air of 82% in a young child is pretty concerning. We can’t see the child so it’s hard to say how difficult their respiratory effort is. I don’t know how far the hospital is, but the possibility the child may worsen during the drive exists. That’s your choice to make, but I my mind the ambulance ride makes sense. 
I would speak to the hospital admissions folks about applying for Medicaid for your child, as someone stated earlier, it will be retroactive to the beginning of the month."
10939,"To leave and go home would definitely be against medical advice, and signing out a child in acute hypoxic respiratory failure would immediately provoke a report to child protective services."
10940,"Read the post again. The only options in this case are an ambulance to the hospital or a call to CPS followed by an ambulance to the hospital.

I'm frankly shocked that the urgent care is holding onto the kid long enough for op to make a reddit post about it."
10941,I am so sorry to hear about your loss. I have taken all the advice to heart and followed the instructions to get my daughter the care she needs.
10942,"For anyone reading, there is no such thing as 'just' the flu. Influenza kills thousands of people, mostly children and the elderly. 

Get your bloody flu shots people."
10943,"Might I suggest you check out NBCs national news each night.  They have been covering the convergence of the flu & RSV for quite awhile. They even showed Texas Children being almost out of beds awhile back.  

The situation for sick kids is very serious.  They have interviewed a lot of families that had no idea RSV was so bad.  They also showed kids with RSV & their chests as they were breathing before they went to the hospital.  

(Sick kids are always at the top of the program, so you don’t have to watch the entire national news, if you don’t want.)

(Please don’t take any offense by this.  I’m just trying to suggest a good, easy to access source for solid information about childhood diseases that are spreading like wildfire right now.)"
10944,"I had no idea it was so bad and it kinds worries me. I'm a daycare teacher and almost all of my kids started getting sick a week ago. My coteacher and I started getting sick last Wednesday,  scratchy throat and we sounded congested but otherwise we both felt fine. Well Saturday hit and things got my bad. I'm coughing so hard the muscles in my stomach hurt. I cough so hard i can't breathe.  It's been a seriously awful weekend. My husband but the humidifier next to the bed and that's starting to help and even thought maybe I could go to work today (we are extremely short staffed) but i don't want to spread anything, especially if this is very hard on children"
10945,"Also, most places will let you set up a payment plan. I had a friend who paid $10 month for 2 years until the bill was settled. It's horrible that finances dictate the amount of health care a person can access.  Please take the ambulance!"
10946,"Adding onto this, many hospitals will work with families to come up with a payment plan. 

I'm not a doc, but have a child who's had pneumonia nearly 2 dozen times plus a scary incidence of RSV. 82% oxygen is very low. Please listen to the urgent care docs, and deal with the financial side of things later. Like the person above said, there are people at the hospital whose job it is to help uninsured people navigate the financial side of things."
10947,"Hospital social worker can help you apply for financial assistance including the hospital's own charitable fund and outside funding  like Medicaid. 


Your daughter needs to be treated so she doesn't get a brain injury from oxygen deprivation. It scrambles your brain, so even when you have all the information you need to make a decision, your brain has trouble finding the info and understanding the consequences of your actions. 


Speaking from experience, Im 15 years post oxygen deprivation & still need 22-24 hour direct supervision because I keep having preventable accidents"
10948,"Former Texas Medicaid caseworker here and OP if you see this, you can apply for coverage beginning this month, but also for three months prior should you need it.  You should be able to apply online at the Your Texas Benefits website (or app)."
10949,"Texas medicaid system is horrifically low for income guidelines. Massive hole of people that make too much for medicaid but not enough to afford treatment. Texas has some of the lowest income limits for medicaid, something insanely ridiculous like 17% of the FPL. (Basically, unless you have no income, you are not getting medicaid, sadly) Compare this to NYS, which allows medicaid for up to 138% of FPL"
10950,"I’m a coder. I’ve seen retroactive Medicaid for up to 90 days. That usually isn’t that hard to get. It just depends on what claims are available. I had a friend that had mental crisis in April and late May. I was able to get both hospital encounters covered, and the ambulance. He hadn’t gotten healthcare in over 10 years. He’s now on Medicaid and is starting to get the care that he needs. He is so much more stable than he was then."
10951,Thank you so much for this!
10952,"I have a slight bone to pick with this, I work in medical billing (in TX) and many facilities have caught on to the procedure this comment describes. Therefore, many are forcing autopay, with a minimum monthly payment that theyll accept. For example, my last hospital bill was $1100 after insurance, and they would not take less than $40 a month, otherwise they will automatically report to collections. It’s a dirty business, so hopefully OP has much better luck."
10953,they still report it to my credit report as regular debt and when i challenge it they sue me
10954,"Great info, very interesting.   When did you read this comment elsewhere, today?   I'd like to see the responses to this...I've read stories about people going bankrupt over medical debt...I wonder if it depends on the state?"
10955,"NAD but have bronchial asthma (basically asthma that kicks in when I’m sick), and it runs in my family - my brother does have full blown asthma. 

I can’t give solid advice like doctors on here, but I can tell you that if it stays in that low range (90 or under for longer than a few hours): A) you need to be treating him with the albuterol nebulizer machine as prescribed to open up his airways - do you have a nebulizer machine at home? It’s a must for anyone with asthma. B) if the nebulizer isn’t bringing up his numbers, or if you don’t have a nebulizer and his numbers stay that low for a while, it’s best to take him in. Reason for this is that his low blood oxygen is depriving his tissues and organs of necessary oxygen to sustain themself; meaning long term can have bad consequences. With that being said, when the o2 is that low, it makes your heart work faster to keep up with the lack of oxygen that the blood isn’t giving.

If it were me in your situation, if I couldn’t get his numbers up with lying still and albuterol treatments, I wouldn’t let it go on for more than an hour or two. 

And, regardless of the number, even if it’s 94% but you notice any blue tinging to the lips or fingers or toes, get him in PRONTO."
10956,"It is.


The kid is in acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia.  I have no idea why a verified physician on this sub would suggest any possibility other than transport by ambulance and admission.


Yeah, I suppose “Leave AMA and have your child potentially die…” is always an option a parent could make.  However that’s not the advice people usually look for on this sub."
10957,[deleted]
10958,Agreed. 100% accurate. If a child is desating off of supplemental O2 or in resp distress before discharge then you'd be correct. But either I didn't read and reread the OPs information wrong or others didn't pay attention to what I wrote or possibly got triggered because anything against AMA certainly carries an emotional charge for us as physicians.
10959,Thank you. Just a total shock to see someone so healthy be taken down so quickly. Hope your daughter has a swift recovery.
10960,Search the hospital's charity care policies to see if your income qualifies you for free care for her!
10961,Please remember kids compensate until they do not. And they may look fine up until they are not. Pediatrics is a whole different animal. Thank you for listening to the advice here
10962,I hope your daughter heals soon! I know it can be hard on the entire family when someone is this sick.
10963,"You can also talk to a social worker at a hospital who can help you get coverage for your daughter. She most likely qualifies for Medicaid and this should be covered, but a social worker can help"
10964,"That’s where I messed up. She’s never had the flu, and I’ve only had it once. Others in my family recovered quickly, children and adults. I had no frame of reference really. I will never make this mistake again and we will be getting flu shots religiously going forward. In fact her doctor said it’s not too late to get one after she’s fully recovered."
10965,"Thank you doctor.  So many people say,  ""I was out of work yesterday because I had the flu""  no you didn't! If you are here now,  you had a cold.  My doctor explained it to me,  ""if you are lying in bed sick and someone tells you that there is a 100 dollar bill on your porch, if you get up and get it,  you DON'T have the flu. """
10966,"You may suggest it, but I’ll pass. I was once a news junkie. Then Trump happened, and I was increasingly depressed, eventually -due to reasons beyond current events exacerbating the situation- I was suicidal. Two letters written, one to go, and detailed plan in place. But it turns out there’s no letter good enough for your child. So, I decided to make some changes to see if they’d help. One of those changes was to stop watching and reading so much news. Now I’m a less informed but much happier living person. We’re all different friend, and I literally couldn’t handle it and also remain mentally and emotionally healthy for my family. So I did what I needed to do."
10967,That’s true. I don’t particularly like doing only payment plans unless there are absolute certain chances of repayment because normally people are struggling and splitting it up isn’t always helpful.
10968,Thank you. The hospital staff also gave me a packet to apply for Medicaid so I am definitely doing that.
10969,"Th reason for this is that Texas is one of eleven states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid. 

[https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/)"
10970,The current Texas Medicaid income guidelines show 144% FPL for Medicaid for a child in a family of two. Texas is pretty terrible but the federal government makes the children's Medicaid guidelines.
10971,"It’s a *little* better for children than it is for adults in TX.  You can be on SSDI & if you have savings, you are disqualified from so many supplemental programs.  At least they raised the income level from $17,000/yr."
10972,I also recommend asking about the hospital system’s charity care. I’m a social worker and I’ve helped patients complete this paperwork.
10973,"Yeah the ""hey sweetie"" person is full of crap. Truth is it financially ruins families and they go into 20 year financial black holes where they have no quality of life and barely survive. Going to the ed and getting admitted is a death sentence for someone. Usually it takes multiple visits. Here anyway they would have turned away the child for breathing through the mask and billed the family 10k for their time, after a 20 hour wait. The ""it doesnt affect you"" comment on collections just means they cant buy a house or finance a car ever again, so theyll pay triple in rent on at buy here pay here's and be poor forever. On the other hand, if they dont take them, they will get life in prison if death occurs."
10974,Yeah I thought medical debt was the biggest reason for bankruptcy in the US. Are all those people just handling it wrong?
10975,"We haven't been given a nebulizer. I'm going to ask about one at his next appointment at the asthma clinic here. He has a maintenance steroid inhaler and an emergency Ventolin inhaler. We've gone to the ER with a steady low 90s oxygen and they will only anything if he is wheezing or having labored breathing. If he's sitting at 91-93% with no wheeze or obvious distress they send us home! Last time we went he was at 92-93% the entire time during triage, and they could hear a wheeze in the lungs. He wasn't monitored in the waiting room. And when we saw the doctor, they prescribed oral prednisone and sent him home- no ventolin or ANY treatment."
10976,"Given that we're opining over the internet, and the UC physician has seen and assessed IRL and wants to transfer, I think it's inappropriate to introduce doubt in this case. Even though, yes, what you're saying is totally reasonable, laypeople on the internet often don't have the ability to understand the nuance that you're trying to provide. This person is at risk of making a very bad decision.

If you got this call from a non-medical family friend: My daughter is hypoxic, has a fast resp rate, has a known pneumonia, should I bring them into the ED for assessment... what would your response be? Would you do some BS equivocating about the reliability of the sat probe or would you just tell them to bring them in? Add to that the UC physician wants to transfer them to your hospital... would you decline the transfer? Fuck no you wouldn't, so why introduce doubt on the necessity of transfer in this case.

The correct answer of the binary yes or no: Given the information in the post, should this child be transferred to the ED is obviously yes."
10977,...but why take that chance? If SPO2 is reading 82% at a medical facility and the patient has been symptomatic for days then that should be taken seriously until vitals are otherwise recorded. She should not be blown off simply because you happen to see some children have different vitals upon arrival to ED sometimes.
10978,Doing this now!
10979,"That is the biggest lesson I have learned throughout this ordeal - they might look fine until they’re not, and it can become a life threatening situation very quickly. I will never second guess myself again when it comes to her health. I thought about taking her to urgent care the day before and I should have. Thankfully we still made it in time. A child’s health cannot be taken lightly and I would literally die myself without her. Advice is what I came here for and I’m so grateful to everyone who provided insight and knowledge that I didn’t have before."
10980,Thank you ❤️ it’s slow progress but still progress! Hoping to go home tomorrow.
10981,"It is definitely worth getting it. Even if she does have influenza, and not one of the other nasty viral infections out there, there are several types of flu you can get. The shots contain scientist's best guesses as to which kinds are going to circulate any given season, and this year, the shot includes 4 types. If she got one now, she can still get the other 3."
10982,"Thank you for learning and the update.  Breathing things with kids get so scary so fast. I grew up poor and asthmatic in a family of asthmatics- we all learned this too.  My brother ended up hospitalized over a week as a kid for something that started small and then turned into double pneumonia and bronchitis by the time it was done.

I’m so, so glad you came here and listened.  (I tend to get the flu yearly, and bad, even with the flu shot.  Without the flu shot, I get it even worse.  I’ve gotten multiple strains in a year so many times.  My immune system is shit.  As a kid the flu was hell on earth.  It always amazes me that it doesn’t hit everyone like that!)

Thank you for listening and learning again, it makes such a difference!"
10983,Definitely get it to keep her safe through the winter
10984,"People in your family may not have had the flu.  People say ""I had the flu"" all the time when they just had other colds and viruses"
10985,[removed]
10986,I’m glad you’re still with us ❤️
10987,"I’m sorry you went through that.  A lot of ppl had a very hard time during 2020 losing family to Covid & a man in power saying it didn’t exist.  I had to get off social media where my “friends” were.  

You need to know when there are health crisis’ with children.  Texas Children in Houston had zero beds available at one point due to RSV & flu in the last month. 

Maybe work on culling the information, so it’s not so overwhelming. NBC is good about giving you headlines prior to the program.  Plus, sick kid news is at the top of the program.  Or perhaps check Texas Children’s website to see what’s happening now w children’s health. 

I’m glad your baby is getting good care now & I wish you the best.  Take care of yourself & your precious one!  ♥️"
10988,"Yes, this was a deliberate choice."
10989,"I was afraid of that. I was hopeful, that at least all children would get coverage…because they’re kids. But I guess OP’s 6yo should just get a job with benefits."
10990,Pro life!
10991,"And yet somehow Abbott was still voted in. Makes
me sick 😔"
10992,"Texans can thank Governor Abbott for refusing federal tax dollars just to prove he is an anti-tax  Republican.

Texans pay taxes; they should get benefits when they need them."
10993,"At the moment I have zero income until I start my new job, so hopefully there are no “rules” that exclude me from receiving aid because I was recently employed and will be again in the near future. I’m not sure how it all works but I’ll be talking to the financial advisor about my options."
10994,I will be speaking with someone in the morning about financial assistance and will ask about this. Thank you!
10995,"You’re kidding - they don’t even give a nebulizer treatment? My brother used to have horrible attacks all the time, and the first thing they did was give him “the tube” to breathe into, even though we had been doing it at home before deciding to take him in. It was their way to gauge to see if the albuterol had any effect before breaking out the big guns. 

I’d definitely ask - if not insist on getting a nebulizer machine for at home if this is chronic (which it sounds like it is). You can buy the machines outright, but still need the prescription for the medication to put in it. 

Inhalers are good to have, too, but unless things have changed significantly in the last ten years or so since we’ve dealt with it, albuterol was always the first thing the doctors turned to, here in Michigan anyways."
10996,"I just want to add, that children’s hospitals have amazing financial programs. This same thing happened to my daughter when she was about 18 months old. She spent 2 nights at the children’s hospital and was fine. CHKD hospital had a tiered system of knocking off 25% 50% 75% or 100% off the bill. We qualified for 75% off, which made the total like $300. The ambulance ride from the pediatrician to the hospital was a turd to deal with, but after at least 3 calls to both my insurance and the ambulance company they finally coded it right or something and I only paid $70. 

Now that I’m a stay at home parent our bills from chkd are 100% discounted and i dont even get bills anymore. I hope your little one feels better soon."
10997,I’m so glad you listened and got her in. 💜
10998,"Oh my gosh how scary!!! That must have taken such a toll on you and your family. Asthma and the flu sounds like an absolute nightmare.

I was there in 2020 and required a psychiatric stay, I was there for 2 weeks and it was going to be around $100,000 a day. But the financial aid team was able to cover it 100% bc they have a charity program there specifically for people who can’t afford treatment."
11008,"I'm in Canada. My husband has asthma too and he remembers getting nebulizer treatments as a kid, but yeah! They've never been used or mentioned for our son at all.

I'll ask his doctors about the nebulizer and see if that's an option"
11009,"I’m sorry your daughter had a hospital stay so young, but I’m glad things worked out well for you financially. This is encouraging for me.

11013,"Yeah, because kids don't require healthy parents to take care of them, lol."
11014,I am looking into this too! :)

Home health.& home  PT had to end 2 weeks ago for Pulmonary Rehab to begin. Pulmonary Rehab now says no if I'm bleeding or can't walk. Trying not to walk, to avoid pressure & bleeding, but with no more home health, or Aide, not possible. Diet forbids restaurant/ processed food. Meals on Wheels can't do special diets. 

Trying to find the humor, life lesson or something good in all this, but failing. 

Elevation and ice definitely helps. Tylenol and low dose opiates I already had. Ok'd for pain. 

Bought a wheelchair.  Definitely going to primary Monday. Hoping the bleeding stops before then.

Not sure how losing a toenail works, but no way this one's going to stay attached. Another reason I have the entire toe area   wrapped"
11024,"I see. Your cardio do not want to stop the bleeding but has no advice on how to stop the bleeding. 

Im sorry about what you've gone through."
11025,"Thank you. Truly appreciate the bonus time for family  But, last few months have been rough. On all of us."

11027,"This is the unlucky end of normal for repeated viral infections in this age range. May be a sign he'll go on to pick up an asthma diagnosis as he gets older, but the key will be how he does when not sick. They do eventually grow bigger, and bigger lungs get too big for bronchiolitis.


I don't care what the sleeping heart rate is as long as the sats and perfusion stay good. If the brain and kidneys are happy with the cardiac output, I'm happy with it. "

11029,"I'm so sorry she's sick, and sorry you feel brushed off. Luckily, it sounds like she's doing ok. This is fairly routine stuff for those of us in pediatrics. Most of what she needs is some time and rest to let her body fight these viruses off, and they're going to keep on monitoring her and keeping her safe while she does that. As long as she's still drinking and having some wet diapers, nothing else that you need to ask about. I would 100% agree with intermittent (not continuous) monitoring."

11033,"Pneumonia can come on quickly. It's very possible that her lungs sounded fine on Saturday, but she developed pneumonia by Monday.

The actual ""sick"" phase of HMPV is more like a week or so. She probably had another virus in February, then got the HMPV more recently."
11034,Thank you so much! I’m trying to understand these illnesses!😂
11035,I think she probably gotten pneumonia after the doctors office because she was lethargic and was not eating. Mostly sleeping the rest of the day.

11038,Non-typable haemophilus lives in/on humans.  It won't all go away.  It's impossible to tell if it's a cause of disease from your story.
11039,.
11040,When the swab from urgent care came back it says there was a high count on the bacterial. Any suggestions on what to do wife his constantly coughing up mucus
11041,Who is prescribing these drugs and doing these swabs?  Is it her PCP?  Is an MD or DO?
11042,Urgent care prescribed the Amoxicillin and pcp prescribed the Augmentin. All swabs done at urgent care
11043,"Stop going to urgent care for this issue.  

Is the PCP an MD or DO?"
11044,I believe an MD
11045,"She should see only this person for this issue going forward.

A lot of urgent cares order silly shit that isn't indicated, then don't interpret the results correctly in the clinical context.

She needs one single person that know what they're doing to manage this."
11046,The problem is the time frame for a sick visit appointment is like 3 weeks. They tell us to go to ER instead 🥴
11047,[deleted]
11048,I think the virus isn't new and has mild symptoms.
11049,"I don't think we really need to worry unless high numbers of people are being hospitalised, needing respiratory support, etc.

Practice usual methods that we'd have during flu seasons. Wash hands, hand sanitizer, etc."
11050,"Flip a coin.

There’s no way to know, really. It’s almost conspiracy-theory level, how little good information is out there. It could be nothing, it could turn into a semi-local epidemic with a few hundred thousand cases in Asia, or it could be something you need to worry about.

I lean towards the first. It’s functionally a basic cold virus, but we don’t know whether it has mutated or to what extent. I’d bet a bit of money that it’ll blow over by spring.

Stay tuned."
11051,"Remember SARS? West Nile? 
All were hyped up and support to be pandemics. 

Those are why it took a while for me to take Covid seriously"
11052,"And all of a sudden China or other countries realises wait it's not HMPV it's a different virus 
Funny that and it's already spread globally"
11053,"I think if you follow basic hygiene practices, like washing your hands, wearing masks, eating healthy, and so on, then you don’t have to worry much about it. Yeah, I mean, if people around you get the virus, then you might have to be cautious. But, you know, just take all the precautions you were taking during COVID times—carry a sanitizer, avoid eating outside. So, just stay home, eat healthy, and focus on your hygiene. I think you’ll be fine."
11054,"whilst the virus is said to not be ""new"", let's not forget viruses constantly mutate, it may not have been a big deal when it first showed up but it can mutate and get stronger and more infectious.

Speaking from personal experience (i'm in SEA), this virus hit me HARD. i think my immune system was already compromised from having COVID before, but i got sick from HMPV twice over the last 2 months.  
All it took was for someone to sneeze or cough near me,and i was out for 2 weeks. I've never been sick like this before.   
it starts with a sore throat then deep. uncontrollable coughing and spitting up phlegm for a week. the coughing literally HURTS.Breathing HURTS because your lungs and airways are so raw and sore from the coughing fits.  Couldn't breathe through my nose either because the nasal passages were congested, basically couldn't sleep for a few nights because of this. My Dr finally caved and gave me steroids and antibiotics after a week, which helped speed up the recovery.   
\*\*THERE IS NO MEDICATION FOR HMPV.\*\*  
All the doctors can do is just give you medication to relieve the coughing and phlegm, but it doesn't kill the virus. Its a rough and long ride to recovery if you get infected.  
  
With COVID, all i had was nausea and fever, and just couldn't get out of bed for a few days because i was so tired. All i had to do was take panadol and just sleep to get better.

I wouldn't wish HMPV on anyone. News/media/governments aren't talking about this because they can't risk another risk worldwide panic and everything shutting down and messing up the economy anymore.Just practice good personal hygiene, i would just play it safe and mask up if you go anywhere indoors or where it's crowded. and best to isolate yourself when you start feeling symptoms. it starts out feeling like a common flu but its very contagious and it takes a long time to get well."
11055,"It's not certain that this will pose a threat or start a lockdown, but it's likely that if you follow my logic

It will become more common, and it's already become more common, it's gonna be very very likely mutate and gain symptoms that risk survival or health and that will be seen through a dire lens and since lockdown:

- 1. Stops the spread
- 2. Was what they already did last time
- 3. Worked with covid

They're VERY likely to start another one

Again, this isn't certain, but it's likely, and panicking costs us nothing but brushing it off means we're unprepared for the most likely outcome"
11056,I just got the virus in US three coworkers got it from one guy . I have bacterial pneumonia from it. Cough still lasting two weeks in my boyfriend
11057,"The virus itself is not the issue, it's a known virus, and part of the population already have some level of immunity to it. It's not as virulent as other viruses, and it's not as severe as others.  
The problem is that it spreads, and will eventually lead to more people getting admitted.   
And the system is already stretched.   
So the concern and worry is not because of HMPV, it's because the system is not prepared for any further pressures on it. There's barely any beds left on a good day."
11058,To be fair we knew about the Covid variant for years before the pandemic as well...
11059,[deleted]
11060,"I already had it and I seem to be alive lol

Though the tiredness does hit a little longer from this one"
11061,Thank you
11062,Apparently there are hospital capacities being reached in the UK but they’re putting it down to flu season. Hopefully it doesn’t turn into a mass panic.
11063,"Ah yes, a single redditor tells you what you want to hear and now everyone else is wrong."
11064,"There are things we need to know. Will it cause autism. Will a vaccine have a micro chip which tracks me. 
If i drink bleach and stick a lightbulb up my arse will that cure me. Have I got to get a stronger saucepan for the 8 o clock racket in support of medical people. The saucepan i used last time won't sit on the hob without wobbling. Will that dipshit Musk be handing out useless advice. So many things to learn but I can't be bothered to check Facebook."
11065,"It's interesting actually because I remember 2019 my family got super sick. And here in the UK we were getting told it was just flu. So some are convinced that we actually had covid in the UK before it was actually reported to have been.

Now 2024/2025. My boss got sick, ended up with pneumonia. My mam got sick around Christmas, ended up hospitalised with pneumonia. And several others have been told they had pneumonia. 

So I wonder if it's a repeat. Oh you just have flu/pneumonia. But it will actually turn out to be whatever is spreading in China.

Just some deja vu! 

Likelihood this is actually what is happening is very slim. I wouldn't panic.

......

It's like a few months ago everyone was freaking about monkey pox and lockdowns for that. Now we hear nothing about it.

The media likes to jump on these stories because of the fear that covid caused. So it gets them lots of clicks."
11066,"Well that redditor is factually correct, so yeah."
11067,"well, what they said is entirely correct so there's that"
11068,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
11069,"The point is that by their own admission OP doesn’t have the appropriate background to evaluate the response, so they’re just whipsawing back and forth from one appeal to authority to another."
11070,Another reminder of the fact that leaving millions without access to basic healthcare hurts us all. Expand Medicare to every uninsured American.
11071,I had this in 2014. Was insanely sick- fever of 104. Fevers came and went for a week. It was awful
11072,"Pretty sure I had this a month ago. I worked in an urgent care so had access to all the usual tests which were negative. One of the nurse practitioners I worked with got it as well and thought it was some kind of pneumovirus. I felt better after sleeping for 3 days and taking it easy for 2 more. Still coughing stuff up though.

If you notice a weird tickle in your throat, that's how it started for my coworkers and I. I have also never sweated more in my life while sick."
11073,Treated a child with this. The uncontrollable fevers were wild. And resps of 100. Scary shit
11074,Important or not I will die any day now. My two year anniversary of my vaccination is quickly approaching.
11075,"My 7yo daughter had this last year, we are in Australia. She was incredibly sick - I thought she had Covid for the first time but it was Human Metapneumovirus. Almost 2 weeks off school, high fevers and very unwell it was awful. I’m sorry it’s going around in the northern hemisphere now and feel for anyone who will be unwell with it (and hope it doesn’t make its way back here to spike again over the next few months)🙏"
11076,Both my kids just got over it. It was a long week. I however am still struggling fighting it off. Going on week 2. The body aches and fevers are terrible.
11077,"11% of how many samples were positive? And that % is 36% higher than before. Ok. 

Call me when you’ve isolated the source."
11078,HMPV is the sound I make when I’m chloroformed.
11079,How about you remove insurance from healthcare alltogether?
11080,"I have it right now. Mine started with a sore throat then woke up with my right nostril being severely congested and it stayed that way for almost three days. 

Coughing up gunk, major snot, fevers that come and go. I’ll have periods of time when I feel alright then I feel my cheeks flush (they get SO red), and boom- the wave of dizziness comes over. Symptoms come back and I’m drained for several hours again."
11081,"Seconding the sweating. For me the sore throat started out as a choking sensation, then it just felt like sandpaper. All my tried and true home remedies (cough drops, chicken soup, etc.) didn't give me even momentary relief from the discomfort."
11082,100…..!?!?!?!!
11083,Mine is already long past. :)
11084,Did you ever get better? I’m on day 17 and hoping to kick it soon. Felt 80% better most of the week but no progress to 100%.
11085,"""The source"" is irrelevant when human to human transfer is happening, but it's likely from poultry."
11086,Godspeed. I still remember how awful that shit was.
11087,No fucking work of a lie. And my idiot coworker kept lying and saying 60 because hes a cunt. Shit thing was kid was just discharged from the hosp that day and flown back out to my remote community. With no panadol. Guess who got a medievac the next day. First time I'd ever heard of this virus. Hands down one of the scarier ones I've ever seen.
11088,"Me too, I've been dead for months."
11089,I still have a lingering cough and my chest hurts horribly when I breathe. I’m on inhaler #2 now but I’m at like 90% now. I’m still ungodly tired and I have no energy
11090,Huh? Sixty what?
11091,"The post 2020 reboot, ""5G Like Me"""
11092,*i am truely sorry for your lots*
11093,"Ugh ok me too. Everything online was saying this should be kicked within a week but anecdotally every adult I know who’s gotten a spring respiratory bug has taken much longer.

Hope you feel 100% soon."
11094,Resps
11095,First time I've ever encountered someone else saying this in the wild
11096,"Yup! My doctors told me that since I’m asthmatic, it’s worse for me. Like this is too long to recover. I’ve never been sick this long. 

I hope you feel better too!!"
11097,"I am on day 10 of this nightmare.  I can’t even talk or I go into coughing fit.  At night the coughing is so bad I am gagging and almost throw up.   I have asthma.  I am on prednisone, antibiotic for sinus infection, Allegra D.  I really see very minimal improvement. Not sleeping because of the cough, the lack of restorative sleep doesn’t help the body fight the virus.  Wishing you all a quick recovery from this."
11098,That was my situation but I was on Zyrtec and Flonase on top of a rescue inhaler and I was using my nebulizar to help breathe. Finally cleared up when we were in Puerto Rico last week. Def felt like forever
11099,"I’m on day five. I work from home and felt it was ridiculous to take time off so I’ve worked through minor things. I’ve worked a total of 8 hours this week and have had to use PTO because this has me feeling absolutely awful. I had Covid once and this has been worse given the symptoms. 

Covid I had a few hours of what felt like labor pains in my hips and lower back for one day. Was fine the rest of the time. I thought it was COVID and tested myself twice but came back negative."
11100,This is not a new virus. We have been testing for it for years. Pretty common respiratory virus. The virus was discovered in like 2000. The testing in the form of the respiratory virus panels have been around for about 12 years. I have seen hMNP cases in the ICU and hospital setting since residency/since testing started.
11101,"This is the one of the RSV viruses, right?"
11102,"By Chloe Mayer: 

There are fears that human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is spreading further across Asia after two sick babies were hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus in India.

China earlier revealed it has been grappling with a spike of patients suffering from the flu-like respiratory infection caused by the virus this winter. The surge in cases—which seems to have particularly affected children—has swept across northern China, but the country has played down fears of another Covid-style pandemic, with politicians noting that such illnesses are common during the winter months.
