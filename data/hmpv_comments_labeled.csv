Covid was borderline worth the lockdowns it caused; it really was quite lethal in people of poor health and the elderly, and also seemed to randomly be more deadly in healthy people. With that said, I think many people agree now that we may have gone abit far after not reacting quickly enough to quell it before it really got going.
