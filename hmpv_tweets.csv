Urgent Care insisting on hospital transfer for 6 year old. I have no insurance and unsure if transfer is necessary.,2022-11-20 23:33:35,156,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/z0ar22/urgent_care_insisting_on_hospital_transfer_for_6/,"My daughter has had flu symptoms for 3 days. She developed a terrible cough accompanied by rapid and rattled breathing. I brought her to urgent care and they’ve done oxygen treatment (her oxygen level was 82 and now at 100 but with the mask in place), an X-ray (showed pneumonia of lower left lung), a blood panel, covid test, and IV fluids. The doctor is saying she needs to be transferred to the children’s hospital for observation and I must opt for the ambulance given her oxygen level upon arrival at urgent care. They do not want her transported without the oxygen mask. Her health is my primary concern and I will do whatever needs to be done for her to be healthy again. My secondary concern is the costs that are stacking up. I’m already at $3k with the urgent care visit, treatments, and impending ambulance ride. I’m sure a whole other set of bills will be applied at the hospital. It’s unfathomable to me that I have to go into debt over flu/pneumonia. Their main concern is dehydration and oxygen levels. In the past I have not questioned medical advice when I should have and ended up over paying, which left me in a financially tight spot for a long time. I want to avoid that especially because I do not have any medical insurance. Do I have any options, or should I just do everything the urgent care doctor is telling me to do? I want my daughter to be healthy and comfortable, but I can’t help but wonder if they are insisting on medical intervention that’s not completely necessary. Any advice is helpful.

Texas

UPDATE 

I hope it’s okay to post an update. I really appreciate all of the informative responses to my post. You all reassured me that I made all the right decisions and that this situation is as serious as the Urgent Care doctor was stating. We took the ambulance to the children’s hospital where they immediately decided to keep my daughter overnight. It would have been a terrible outcome had we not come when we did. She was in so much distress and I honestly could not tell how bad it was. She is still working hard to breathe but it’s gotten much better. I will remember a lot of your key points for the future so I can act swiftly if we ever find ourselves in a similar situation. As far as the medical bills, I appreciate the advice and will explore every option available to me. I have been unemployed for a month but will be starting a new job in 2 weeks. I hope I am able to qualify her for Chip or Medicaid, but there seems to be additional assistance either way.

Thank you all again, from the bottom of my heart. My baby is strong and brave, and she is pulling through like a champ!

Whatever the cost, you’ve gotta pay - she can not be without oxygen and monitoring for any length of time right now, at any time she could tire out, have a respiratory arrest, and die. \n\nI can’t overstate this enough, she needs treatment.', 'We are seeing very sick children right now with pneumonia on top of flu. It is bad, bad, bad across the country.\n\nThe triad of low oxygen plus fast respiratory rate plus fatigue/increased work of breathing is what comes before they drop off that cliff. Unfortunately, kids are NOT adults; they exhaust their reserve without many signs that the collapse is immanent. You can\'t wait until they ""look worse."" This is what they look like when they are in crisis.\n\nPlease let them take her to the hospital in the ambulance. Honestly, although triage shouldn\'t work this way, it may make it even an inch more likely to get the last bed there. The last night I was on call, I spent the next day pulling together the direct line numbers for ""transfer centers"" (or the equivalent) for children\'s hospitals in the surrounding seven states.\n\nI\'d had to call four children\'s hospitals before I could find one for transfer. Well, one of them would have taken her, but there was a 24 hour wait expected -- and we don\'t have kid-sized ventilators here. The last time I saw one like this, we did intubate and just tried our best while awaiting transport.\n\nChildren\'s hospitals are in crisis. This is our version of the 2019 surge. RSV and flu are hitting hard, and COVID is still there, but it\'s the secondary pneumonias that are doing them in. Check out the nursing subreddit.

It is awful to have to choose.', 'I’m sorry this is happening to your daughter.\n\nThere is no safe option other than the ambulance ride with the oxygen mask.\n\nSpeak with the hospital social worker while she is admitted. If you are under a certain income level, it is likely that your daughter will qualify for a state-funded children’s health care plan. If she qualifies, this will be retroactive to the care she is about to receive, since she qualified all along.\n\nIf not, ask about applying for charity care/bill forgiveness through the hospital. This option will take perseverance, but there are organizations that can help you advocate for yourself if you get a bill that seems unfair.\n\nGood luck.', 'It really makes me sad when cost is a financial barrier to healthcare – I’m sorry to hear your daughter is sick and that the costs are already adding up\n\nAn oxygen saturation of 82% is very low, normally we want it in a young healthy child to be at least 97%, ideally higher. Hypoxemia can cause considerable damage to many parts of the body. If she needs to be on an oxygen mask (beyond even nasal prongs) to keep her oxygen levels at normal range, that’s quite serious (even if you feel your daughter currently doesn’t physically appear to look that sick).

You have the option of driving your child to the hospital yourself but you\'ll be taking the risk. The chance that your child will get super sick with you taking her or an ambulance taking her is low. \n\nAs for whether you need to go to the hospital, that\'s harder to know without seeing the child. Statistically most transfers of such sort are to prevent you from suiting the doctor afterward when shit goes wrong. And yes, people sue their doctors when we don\'t take every possible last resort to prevent something even remotely from happening. \n\nIf my child can maintain her oxygen and stay hydrated at home and there is no signs of sepsis then I would take my child home and if something goes wrong I would go follow up with a good pediatrician or go back to the urgent care or walk into an ER.', 'Thank you for pointing this out.

I want to let you know that what you’re feeling is normal, but only because people don’t understand how not serious this is. So take a few deep breaths and let me explain…\n\nInsurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf. We frequently gets these bills reduced by 40, 50, 60%. This has caused providers to pad their bills, knowing they will only receive a small portion. That, plus all the uninsured folks who never pay, means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic services.\n\nYou do not have to pay this bill. Ever. They can’t do anything to you. No one will force you. It will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt. This is America. Literally everyone has medical debt. It won’t stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house. It doesn’t make a difference.\n\nIn a few years, the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar. Then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times, trying to settle with you. At this point, if you want to settle, offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full. They will likely take it.\n\nIf you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you’re making the payments, it won’t get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).\n\nPlease don’t do anything drastic.

The child does not have any travel history.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), similar to COVID-19, can cause respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.The symptoms of the disease typically appear 3 to 10 days after infection and include flu-like signs such as cough, blocked nose, runny nose, sore throat, and breathing difficulties.

HPMV scare is bullshit. People selling in panic,2025-01-06 14:56:05,199,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1huv879/hpmv_scare_is_bullshit_people_selling_in_panic/,"Checked everything available on internet regarding HMPV. Here are some bullet points. 
1) already existing virus. Nothing new. Infact last year china had more cases of hpmv than this year. 
2) mortality rate less than 1% in kids. Mostly affects kids. 
3) one affected kid in bengaluru already discharged. 
4) its quite a common virus but people are scared due to some new variation affecting china. But china is normal looks like more of a media hype. 
Except India there is no panic selling in global markets due to hpmv yet. Infact taiwan and hang seng are up. So was S&P and nasdaq yesterday.

In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week. \n\nFor a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks.

Să ne uităm întâi la ce este cunoscut, înainte de a genera alte mesaje foarte alarmiste🤗\n\nPentru majoritatea pediatrilor nu a fost nicio surpriză! Virusul a fost descris în 2001 de către dr Bernadette van den Hoogen la copii răciți din Olanda, deși el exista de multă vreme. Se estimează ca el s-a desprins dintr-o familie de virusuri similare ce infectează păsările. Acum aproximativ 400 de ani.\n\nNu am știut să îl detectăm până acum dar el există de foarte multă vreme.\n\nEu am un slide dedicat hMPV, în cursul despre bronșiolita acută pe care îl țin la studenți, de peste 15 ani.\n\nÎn 2012 am publicat, alături de colegii de la Spitalul Grigore Alexandrescu și de colectivul de experți ai Centrului Național de Referință în Boli Respiratorii de la Institutul Cantacuzino (condus la acea vreme de către dna dr Cristina Țecu) rezultatele unei cercetări ce își dorea să evalueze ce virusuri produc boli respiratorii  cu spitalizare (cum ar fi bronșiolita acută sau pneumonia) la copii.\n\nCel mai frecvent identificați, la acel moment, au fost VSR (virusul sincițial respirator), hMPV și adenovirus. Link in comentarii\n\nDeci nimic nou sub soare🤗\n\nDe unde emoția? Pentru că vorbim despre un virus obișnuit, din familia Paramyxoviridae, rudă cu virusul rujeolos, de exemplu.\n\nProbabil ne-am speriat din cauza faptului că ACUM stim că există acest ""dușman"", pentru că putem testa PCR-multiplex, în timp real, un număr extrem mare de persoane. Este moștenirea pandemiei...\n\nAceste teste PCR-multiplex pot identifica rapid peste 20 de virusuri și bacterii din secrețiile nazale ale unui bolnav.\n\nDeci acum AM AFLAT cu toții că există hMPV, deși el era pe podium, alaturi de VSR și rhinovirusuri drept cauză a bolilor respiratorii. Este atât de frecvent încât 90% din copiii care merg la grădiniță vor face până la 5 ani o infecție cu hMPV. Și pentru că imunitatea pentru acest virus ""nu ține"", boala se poate repeta oricând.\n\nLa fel ca și la gripă, au fost descrise 4 tipuri de hMPV, în funcție de proteinele de suprafață F (de fuziune) și G (de atașament) care sunt  notate cu A1, A2, B1 și B2.\n\nEste o simplă răceală pentru persoanele adulte sănatoase sau pentru copiii mai mari. Poate ceva mai zgomotoasă în 2025 decât în alți ani, dar cam atât.\n\nSoluția?? Avem răbdare, luăm antitermice și ne hidratăm bine. Dacă e rău în continuare după 2-3 zile mergem la medic.\n\nȘi nu dăm și altora boala!!!

The last pandemic was over a hundred years before COVID. We are surrounded by viruses. The “common cold” is caused by over 200 strains of virus with four strains of coronavirus contributing. There are dozens if not hundreds of strains of influenza circulating in humans and animals. 

Yet every sniffle anywhere in the world results in calls for the next pandemic, masking and lockdowns. Monkey pox, norovirus, RSV, HMPV, bird flu - every one is an existential crisis according to the media fear machine. Nobody likes getting sick, but if you have a functioning immune system, you have little to fear and getting sick is an essential component of building immunity towards future infections. Get your childhood immunization, get your flu vaccines and if you are vulnerable, get your COVID, shingles and any boosters you may need.

That is a genuinely *massive* concern and should not be downplayed. There is not an epidemiologist in the world right now which is not extremely concerned about bird flu mutating for human transmissibility. It has spread to animal populations worldwide at a rate we have never seen in the past year, and is rapidly approaching the ability to cause human to human transmission. Bird flu has a mortality rate of 40%. This is not something to scoff at.  \n\nEven assuming bird flu doesn't materialize into anything?

Source Warns H5N1 Avian Flu Outbreak in Humans Spreading in China [Non-Credible Source] ,2025-01-14 20:54:13,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagionCuriosity/comments/1i18get/source_warns_h5n1_avian_flu_outbreak_in_humans/,"Hi everyone, 

Just wanted to get ahead of this story before you start seeing it in other places. [NTD News](https://www.ntd.com/source-warns-h5n1-avian-flu-outbreak-in-humans-spreading-in-china_1040161.html), is reporting an *alleged* human avian flu outbreak in China, but again please **be wary of these reports since NTD News is a Falun Gong run, known misinformation machine**  [Source](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ntd-tv-new-tang-dynasty/) 

After the hMPV situation, we have all seen how one NTD article and tweet can start panic on social media, so I'm expecting more of the same following this report. The article is below:

>""China is allegedly seeing more human infections of H5N1, according to a source working in China’s disease monitoring and prevention sector.

>NTD has concealed the individual’s identity for security reasons. The source says there have been at least 100 H5N1 infections in the country to date. Authorities are said to be building isolation facilities near some highways.""

Will be keeping an eye on this, regardless.

A [series of **Los Angeles fires**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/fast-dry-winds-california-wildfires) has wrought destruction to the region, torching 10,000+ homes and [killing at least 16](https://www.euronews.com/2025/01/12/la-officials-say-wildfire-death-toll-stands-at-16-as-firefighters-race-to-contain-blazes). The fires are [among the most destructive](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/la-fires-acres-burned-damage) in LA’s history—and probably the most costly in terms of monetary damage, with at least $55B worth of destruction (other sources say [**$150B+ of damage**](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-los-angeles-wildfires-figures.html)). [Over 900 prisoners](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rwdjwglx2o) were recruited to fight the fires, paid about $10 per day. Many of the blazes are still uncontained. [This photo essay](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rqrqx4egro) captures some of the **destruction & panic** from the LA wildfires. 

The 58-page [**Global Water Monitor Report**](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/global-water-monitor-2024-summary-report) for 2024 was released last week, and it details the current state of earth’s water cycle, along with risks, challenges, and statistics. Snapshots of particular hydrological disasters (usually floods) in particular regions are also provided. The outlook for 2025 predicts a worse hydrological year than 2024.

>“Several countries {in 2024} recorded their highest annual precipitation totals since 1979….A total of 23 countries recorded their highest annual daily maximum rainfall in 2024….Eight countries recorded record-low annual [NDVI {normalised vegetation difference index}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index): Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi…Cambodia and Lao{s}…Morocco…Belize…and Iceland….Fifteen countries recorded record-low annual surface water extent in 2024….Thirty-one countries recorded record-high annual surface water extent….Global average terrestrial water storage continued its apparent **long-term decline**, with an average value of 31 mm below the 2002–2005 baseline. This represents a significant declining trend of 19 mm per decade….” -selections from [the report](https://www.globalwater.online/globalwater/report/index.html) 

In Ghana, a large [secondhand market was burned](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/03/massive-cleanup-under-way-after-fire-destroys-one-of-worlds-biggest-secondhand-markets-ghana), destroying the livelihood of some 30,000 small-scale entrepreneurs. The cause is still unknown. In Tibet, a [**7.1 earthquake**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/07/tibet-earthquake-live-updates-strong-quake-shigatse-city-nepal-bihar-latest-news) on Tuesday leveled 1,000+ homes and [killed 125+ people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/tibet-earthquake-holy-city-of-shigatse-nepal-magnitude-quake). 

China is expected to [**grow coal production** this year](https://archive.ph/t3bSA) by 1.5% to meet rising energy demand. Meanwhile, the EU is [generating far less wind power](https://archive.ph/1yHI9) than they need, and not expected to increase production to meet 2030 targets. And Phoenix, Arizona, currently at 141 days without rain, is [approaching its all-time record](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/phoenix-days-without-rain-streak-ranking-20933249): 160 days. 

A [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/climate-change-showing-its-claws-world-getting-hotter-resulting-severe-hurricanes-thunderstorms-and-floods-ende) claims that natural disasters last year resulted in **$320B worth of damage** worldwide—about a third of which was insured. It is also the highest cost on record (for now). Deaths from natural disasters, however, were “significantly fewer than the average,” measuring about 11,000.

The UK felt [its coldest January night](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7z903ll25o) in 15 years, when temperatures in Scotland dropped to **-18.9 °C** (-2 °F) early on Saturday morning. [Several **heat records**](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1876943754252189798) were set across Oceania, and [in Brazil](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1876787940631724360). New [snowfall record](https://www.newsinenglish.no/2025/01/07/snowfall-breaks-records-as-ice-fears-rise/) in southern Norway. In China, [**glaciers are melting**](https://www.eco-business.com/news/what-chance-for-chinas-melting-glaciers/) faster than they, and their implications, can be studied. 

A [slow-motion **water crisis** is brewing](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/water-tensions-under-taliban) in Afghanistan. In the UK, [bees are beginning hibernation much later](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg17mwnx73o) than usual, a result of warm weather. In South Africa, [**lightning storms** killed eleven](https://witness.co.za/news/2025/01/08/kzn-weather-11-dead-six-year-old-boy-killed-in-lightning-strike/) individuals. And a *Nature* [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08375-z) claims that about 25% of “freshwater fauna {are} threatened with extinction.”

A [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GC011743) published several weeks ago in *Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems* claims that, as the Antarctic ice sheets melt, downward pressure is decreased on subglacial volcanoes—thus increasing volcanic eruptions underneath, which **hasten the melting of glaciers** even more. Scientists say this process, while alarming, will not happen overnight, but occur on the scale of many decades or centuries. 

A [round-up of environmental disasters](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-025-4540-4) was published on Saturday in *Advances in Atmospheric Sciences*. Several national weather agencies, like those in the UK and Japan, say [earth breached 1.5 °C of warming in 2024, and that it was the hottest year on record. [NASA and NOAA both claim](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-temperatures-nasa-warmest-year.html), at the moment anyway, that earth’s warming has not quite hit 1.5 °C, but they concede that it was the warmest year on record for the United States and for the planet, and “likely the **hottest for the planet in 125,000 years**.” The ocean also hit record high temperatures, according to [another study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-025-4541-3) in *Advances in Atmospheric Sciences* published on Friday.

The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service [also confirmed the **record-breaking figures** for 2024](https://climate.copernicus.eu/global-climate-highlights-2024). They also claim that 2024 saw the largest concentration of water vapor in the air on record. The full report is quite alarming, and worth skimming if only for the graphics.

The respiratory illness [**Human Metapneumovirus**](https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html) (HMPV) [is spiking in China](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23vjg7v7k0o), alarming observers who fear it may be more dangerous than reports suggest. The sickness is a common respiratory malady like the flu.

The United States recorded [its first human death](https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2025/01/07/first-h5-bird-flu-death-reported-in-united-states/) from **bird flu** last week in a Louisiana patient. Officials believe the deceased contracted the virus from his/her backyard brood of chickens, which got sick from an interaction with wild birds. [One human infection](https://archive.ph/6q7dF) in San Francisco recorded last week seems to have had no known source of infection. Recent human infections [are worrying some](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/health/bird-flu-h5n1-pandemic-risk-explained/index.html) who believe it will become our next devastating global pandemic. 

Rumors of [**devastating tariffs**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/trump-tariffs-national-economic-emergency) being imposed by the U.S. may now occur after a declaration of an “economic emergency.” Data from Germany indicate that [the number of large German businesses declaring bankruptcy surpassed](https://www.gulf-insider.com/germany-faces-highest-number-of-bankruptcies/) the number from the 2008-09 financial crisis. South Korea’s ongoing political crisis [is affecting its economy](https://www.dw.com/en/south-koreas-political-crisis-dragging-down-economy/a-71227722) negatively and undermining faith in the country’s future stability. [**Inflation** worsens](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/01/06/bolivian-inflation-soars-amid-political-unrest-and-poor-weather) in Bolivia; their story is [one of many](https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2935067/developing-nations-face-solvency-crisis). 

**Government debt** is emerging as a “ticking time bomb”—but [so is **corporate debt**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-next-global-financial-crisis-is-closer-than-you-think/ar-AA1wWLOG), totaling some $22T worldwide. U.S.-based companies hold over 10% of this debt, and some analysts believe this long-ignored problem may blow up later this year; [corporate bankruptcies are already at 14-year highs](https://archive.ph/Vzl0w). More than 20% of Canadians [believe](https://globalnews.ca/news/10946620/credit-card-debt-transunion-report/) they will end 2025 with more debt than they began the year. An [increasingly competitive world economy](https://archive.ph/58NsW) will likely see further “flatlining of co-operation” among countries.

Thailand [banned plastics imports](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/07/thailand-bans-imports-plastic-waste-curb-toxic-pollution) in an effort to reduce pollution in the country. A [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/toxicology/articles/10.3389/ftox.2024.1469995/full) in *Frontiers in Toxicology* determined that **microplastics are super common** in a variety of seafood, especially shrimp, herring, lingcod, and lamprey.  

Pakistan’s government [announced](https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/sewage-samples-test-positive-poliovirus-17-districts) that 17 districts have tested positive for **polio** in their wastewater.

[This account](https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/shifting-dial-long-covid) from a Long COVID sufferer explains what the experience of Long COVID can be like, and summarizes much of the scientific understanding of the illness. Another [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01487-4) published last week **links Long COVID to “neurodegenerative processes**, including Alzheimer’s disease.”

A well-composed [42-page **Global Risks Report**](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2025) for 2025 concludes that we are entering “an era when no one power or group of powers is both willing and able to drive a global agenda,” the so-called “**G-Zero World**.” This think tank writes that the most prominent threats are: Trump’s new presidency bringing global instability; US-China tension; economic problems like debt & inflation; Russia’s hybrid (and not-so-hybrid) warfare; the dangers of a Collapsing Iran and what it would mean for the region; **unregulated AI** and its multifaceted hazards; ungoverned regions slipping into chaos (*à la* Haiti); and the potential upcoming struggle between Mexico and the United States. 

>“The risk of a **generational world crisis**, even a new global war, is higher than at any point in our lifetimes….We’re entering a uniquely dangerous period of world history on par with the 1930s and the early Cold War….Trump will stretch the norms of Washington to their breaking point….Chinese leaders are prepared to respond {to Trump} more forcefully and will be less likely to offer concessions, fearing domestic perceptions of national humiliation….Russia will take **hostile, asymmetric steps** against EU countries….Putin believes Russia is at war with NATO in Ukraine and that victory is of existential importance…Global growth is tepid, inflation remains sticky, and debt levels are at historic highs. Most emerging markets never fully recovered from Covid-era spending sprees….As AI capabilities are pushed further, faster, and with fewer checks in place, the risks of a catastrophic accident or an uncontrollable **AI “breakout”** will grow….The race to develop frontier models and achieve artificial general intelligence will accordingly accelerate in 2025, driving unprecedented demands on power, water, and land resources….Conflict in the Middle East has left five **ungoverned spaces**—Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. In Gaza, criminal gangs, family clans, surviving Hamas members, and the Israeli military will rule over the decimated Palestinian population for the foreseeable future…” -excerpts from the report

Guinea’s post-coup government is [facing protests](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/guineas-junta-faces-protests-after-missing-deadline-return-117408465), and momentarily locked down neighborhoods in the capital, after after long-promised, long-delayed elections were once again delayed. 

The United States has [labeled the Sudan-based RSF rebels’ actions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/us-determines-sudan-paramilitary-genocide) as genocide, and sanctioned some entities operating in and with the Sudanese rebels.

The official **death toll in Gaza** [**surpassed 46,000**](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-01-09-2025-ffae654d619e8e848e2ceda8576e8fe5) last week, although an [analysis of the dead](https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-death-toll-41-higher-than-official-figures-study-contends/7932849.html) suggests a more accurate figure is about **65,000**. Although [some believe](https://archive.ph/ua5xN) a ceasefire is weeks away from being agreed, others believe Hamas’ guerrilla warfare and Israeli ambitions will preclude a good faith agreement. Israel’s plans for “the complete defeat of Hamas” [are supposedly in the works](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/israeli-defence-minister-demands-plan-for-hamas-defeat/ar-BB1reqzv) if Hamas’ remaining hostages are not returned by 20 January.

Ukraine [struck an oil depot](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/europe/ukraine-russia-engels-saratov-oil-depot-drone-intl/index.html) deep inside Russia.

Starting tonight, gusts will climb to 30–60 mph, drying out vegetation and carrying embers 1–2 miles ahead of the fireline.

Fragile containment lines will likely fail, and the fires will spread into areas that feel “safe” right now.\n2. Air quality will plummet. Smoke and ash will blanket much of LA by Monday afternoon, with air quality reaching hazardous levels (AQI 300–400). Outdoor activity will become dangerous even far from the flames, and ash will cover streets and cars across the city.\n3. Evacuations and gridlock will follow. Expanded evacuation orders in urban zones will overwhelm the 405, 10 Freeway, and Sunset Blvd. Schools reopening Monday morning may close abruptly as conditions worsen, adding to the traffic chaos.\n4. Rolling blackouts and resource strain. Utilities will likely shut off power in high-risk zones to prevent further ignitions, leaving thousands without electricity or reliable communication. Fire crews will shift from containment to structure defense, stretching resources thin.\n5. By Tuesday, LA could feel apocalyptic. Fires doubling in size. Ash falling everywhere. Smoke making the city feel unlivable.\n\nThis isn’t a guarantee, but the conditions are all there for this to happen. Fires don’t need to be visible or close to your block to cause chaos. Embers can travel miles ahead of the fireline, sparking new blazes in areas that seem calm today.\n\nLA is walking into a pivotal 48 hours.

"HMPV, RSV, H5N1: Why the world is under attack from respiratory viruses",2025-01-10 01:01:25,16,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/hmpv-rsv-h5n1-fly-covid-seasonal-respiratory-viruses/,"A predictable winter illness season has caused alarm – but are we missing the real threat?

The evidence has been piling up all around us for months.

Lurid headlines warning of a “quad-demic” and a mysterious virus spreading in China; relatives sickened for weeks with flu and hospitals stretched to breaking point.

Little more than a year-and-a-half after the Covid-19 pandemic was finally declared over, the world is once again under attack from respiratory viruses.

This time, though, the waves of infections are not the result of a new pandemic pathogen. Instead, the apparent onslaught is the result of a seasonal spike in respiratory disease.

Every year, a host of illnesses including colds and flu surge as the air becomes cooler and drier and people spend more time indoors, making it easier for viruses to spread.

The effects can be severe – hospitals across the world come under intense pressure from millions of people requiring treatment for respiratory conditions. Hundreds of thousands of people will be killed by influenza alone.

This winter is no exception. But is this annual respiratory virus season really as bad as it seems?

What – if anything – has changed this time? And, with so many viruses going around and an outbreak in China causing an almost farcical global panic, could the real threat be slipping under the radar?

**How bad is the 2024 / 2025 flu season?**

Ask anyone who caught the flu over the Christmas holiday in the UK in the last few weeks and they will probably testify that the illness they had was a nasty one.

This year’s dominant strain is H1N1, a descendent of those that caused pandemics in 1918, 1977 and 2009, and it is certainly weighing heavily on the country’s health service.

In a surveillance report for the final week of 2024, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said flu activity had “increased across most indicators and was circulating at high levels”.

In real terms, this meant that more than 4,000 people spent Christmas day in hospital with flu and by the end of that week the number had climbed past 5,000, according to data from the NHS.

The health service warned of hospital flu cases quadrupling in a month – undoubtedly a dramatic increase in the number of seriously ill patients. But take a step back and a different picture emerges.

“The number of hospitalisations in England is significantly worse than at this stage last year but it is not unprecedented,” said Dr Leon Peto, a Consultant in Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at the University of Oxford.

“Currently the number of hospitalisations is similar to the winter 2022-23 flu season, which at its height caused around 5,000 deaths per week in England.”

While it may not be an extreme outlier, lower than usual vaccination rates could be to blame for the apparent severity of the UK’s flu season, especially when compared against the previous year.

During the pandemic the UK government ran an expanded flu vaccination programme, offering free jabs to anyone over 50. But it has now reverted to offering the vaccine only to those over 65 or with risk factors.

“The uptake of vaccine this year has been lower than last year,” said Prof Penny Ward, Visiting Professor in Pharmaceutical Medicine at King’s College London.

“Around 73 per cent of older adults have been vaccinated but fewer than 35 per cent of higher risk adults of any age have been vaccinated so far,” she said. “This uptake rate is lower than is needed (90 per cent) to limit the extent of flu outbreaks.”

Among frontline health workers the uptake rate is even lower – during the 2023/2024 season, only 42.8 percent of them got the flu jab.

Despite the impact of low vaccination rates, most of the experts the Telegraph spoke to agreed that this year’s influenza outbreak in the UK was roughly in line with what was expected, and it’s been a similar story in most other developed countries.

On top of that, the so-called “quad-demic” of flu, Covid, RSV and Norovirus that had been forecast in doom-laden newspaper headlines failed to materialise.

“We’re not seeing a ‘quad-demic’ and, to be honest, I don’t think we ever were,” said Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia.

“Clearly flu is up, norovirus is up,” he told The Telegraph.

Yet cases of RSV had already peaked in November, when people first started talking about a ‘quad-demic’, and Covid cases are near baseline levels, he said.

So how is it that a predictable surge in respiratory diseases has come to represent such a threat?

A major factor is how basic resources – think spaces in hospital beds, availability of staff and access to treatments – are being managed.

“It feels bad every year because we run the system at near to capacity,” said Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, from the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford.

“If you then have the completely expected winter surge in respiratory viruses [...] it will always tip over the edge,” he told The Telegraph.

Ageing populations around the world, particularly in high-income countries, are also compounding healthcare capacity crises.

“One of the reasons why this is getting worse and will continue to get worse, is because of the change in the demographics of the population,” said Prof Pollard.

“We have more old people this year than we did 10 years ago, and in 20 years from now, [we will have] even more. And that means that that capacity problem – unless you have a different way of managing health and social care – is going to continue to worsen in the decades ahead.”


[...] 

**We have no resilience at all’**

But there is a thin line between flaky headlines and genuine disaster.

Seasonal respiratory outbreaks are a regular occurrence but it is also almost certainly true that it will be a respiratory pathogen that causes the next pandemic.

Virtually all experts agree that respiratory diseases pose the greatest threat. It’s partly because we are physiologically and socially vulnerable to them – we coop ourselves up in densely packed cities and talk to each other directly through the orifices that respiratory viruses enter through.

But it is also because animals, particularly those that are farmed intensively, are vulnerable too and provide both a reservoir for mutations and a bridge to humans.

The biggest worry at the moment is a case in point.

Even as the world fixates on hMPV, a genuine pandemic threat is emerging in the form of H5N1 bird flu.

The virus has jumped to cows and spread across the country through dairy herds, poultry farms and even zoos, infecting millions of animals and dozens of people, the vast majority of them farm workers.

This week, a man from Louisiana became the first person ever to die from H5N1 bird flu in the United States after catching the virus, it is believed, directly from birds.

H5N1 does not yet have the ability to transmit between people, but it is now thought that just a single mutation may make it able to do so, and there are significant concerns among those monitoring the US outbreak over the risk of H5N1 mixing with other strains in circulation this winter and causing a pandemic.

So while the media furore over this winter respiratory virus season may be overblown, what is clear from the damage that predictable surges of known pathogens are doing is that healthcare systems are vulnerable to emerging threats.

“These viruses cause a problem for the NHS every year,” said Prof Pollard.

But instead of fixating on the ambulances queued up today, the health authorities should be thinking about how to build “sufficient resilience in hospitals and social care to cope with the burden of the elderly” and about how to bring in “better-managed” vaccine programmes to reduce hospitalisations during predictable surges of disease.

Is HMPV another Covid-19-like scare in China?

Five years after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, China is grappling with an outbreak of the human metapneumovirus (HMPV). 

Reports and social media posts suggest that the virus is spreading rapidly, with allegations of overwhelmed hospitals and crematories. 

Online videos show overcrowded hospitals, while users claim that multiple viruses — including influenza A, HMPV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Covid-19 — are circulating simultaneously.

New Virus In China Is The Next Pandemic ,2025-01-06 21:51:45,125,https://i.redd.it/aoc1zft0gebe1.jpeg,"Bill Gates is trying to launch more Pandemic hysteria. Operation Catastrophic Contagion looks like is in full swing with a new pandemic about to emerge from China.

It is just like last time with Covid, they do tabletop exercise and then we get a new pandemic.

HMPV cases are now reportedly rising in Malaysia. In 2024, 327 HMPV cases were reported in the country, a 45% increase compared to 225 cases in 2023. This increase comes amidst reports of rising respiratory illnesses in other countries, including China.

2017. This scenario explores potential health risks and challenges we may face between 2025 and 2028.

China in Crisis as Viral Outbreak Overwhelms Hospitals and Crematoriums Nationwide | EconoTimes,2025-01-02 06:53:40,55,https://www.econotimes.com/China-in-Crisis-as-Viral-Outbreak-Overwhelms-Hospitals-and-Crematoriums-Nationwide-1698282,"Hospitals overrun, crematoriums strained, and citizens panicking—China grapples with a state of emergency as multiple respiratory viruses wreak havoc.

Nationwide Emergency Declared Amid Unprecedented Health Crisis

China has declared a state of emergency as a severe outbreak of multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza A, Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and COVID-19, overwhelms healthcare systems across the nation. The alarming situation has strained hospitals, exhausted medical staff, and pushed crematoriums beyond their capacity.

Officials announced the emergency after an alarming surge in cases that experts describe as unprecedented in scope. In densely populated cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, patients reportedly face hours-long waits for hospital beds, and many are forced to seek care in crowded hallways. Videos circulating on social media depict overflowing crematoriums, with reports of extended delays for funerary services.

Healthcare Systems Buckle Under Immense Pressure

Medical professionals describe a dire situation, with hospitals unable to keep pace with the surge. Doctors and nurses are reportedly working double shifts as resources dwindle. Essential medications and oxygen supplies are in short supply, exacerbating the crisis.

Local media reports suggest that crematoriums in several provinces have seen an unprecedented influx of bodies, forcing authorities to extend operating hours. Families are struggling to secure cremation slots, underscoring the emotional toll of the outbreak.

One healthcare worker in Beijing described the scene as ""chaotic,"" adding, ""This is worse than the early days of COVID. We’re running on fumes, and the end is nowhere in sight.""

Netizens React to the Nationwide Emergency

Social media platforms have been flooded with reactions from Chinese citizens and international observers. Many expressed fear and outrage, while others offered solidarity and prayers.

“Heartbreaking to see my hometown struggling like this. Stay safe, everyone,” tweeted @ShanghaiSoul.

“Why does this keep happening? We need better pandemic preparedness globally!” wrote @HealthMatters2025.

Others criticized the government’s handling of the crisis. “Another preventable disaster. When will the lessons from the past finally stick?” lamented @BeijingBlues.

Some users voiced skepticism about official narratives. “How much of the truth are we really hearing? Feels like déjà vu from 2020,” questioned @TruthSeeker88.

Meanwhile, international users expressed concern. “Sending thoughts to everyone in China. Hoping for a swift resolution,” posted @GlobalHelpNetwork.

“Yet another reason we need a united global health response,” suggested @WorldHealthAction.

What’s Next for China?

The Chinese government has pledged swift action, deploying additional medical personnel to hard-hit regions and ramping up production of essential supplies. However, experts warn that systemic issues, including overcrowded urban centers and stretched public health resources, may complicate recovery efforts.

International health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have expressed readiness to assist China. While containment measures are being implemented, experts believe the crisis underscores the need for long-term investments in healthcare infrastructure.

As the emergency unfolds, the world watches closely, hoping China can stem the tide of this devastating outbreak and prevent further escalation.","[Comment(id='m55d1eg'), Comment(id='m4xxh7v'), Comment(id='m4y6g2g'), Comment(id='m4yo32w'), Comment(id='m4zbzm9'), Comment(id='m518yzv'), Comment(id='m4y3gwn'), Comment(id='m4yqet4'), Comment(id='m4zcod6'), Comment(id='m50uw06'), Comment(id='m50yk7l'), Comment(id='m51iqek'), Comment(id='m51zj6n'), Comment(id='m5dscbv'), Comment(id='m4xw9dc'), Comment(id='m4zbdhi'), Comment(id='m50duft'), Comment(id='m4yiw8n'), Comment(id='m4y4tg8'), Comment(id='m557zjd'), Comment(id='m4y9c3c'), Comment(id='m4yqm89'), Comment(id='m54gdkj'), Comment(id='m52xnoc'), Comment(id='m4y9msz'), Comment(id='m52t8dh'), Comment(id='m55d5zi'), Comment(id='m52gi82'), Comment(id='m55d38e'), Comment(id='m52syo8'), Comment(id='m52z202'), Comment(id='m4yl3cq'), Comment(id='m4yll2c'), Comment(id='m4ytm5o'), Comment(id='m534p2b'), Comment(id='m4ydie9'), Comment(id='m52xeii'), Comment(id='m52prz3'), Comment(id='m530vp5'), Comment(id='m4ymnct'), Comment(id='m4ync5e'), Comment(id='m550zno'), Comment(id='m4yunrc'), Comment(id='m4ygeeb'), Comment(id='m52zpd7'), Comment(id='m51eg8f'), Comment(id='m4yp02u'), Comment(id='m4yuyaj'), Comment(id='m4yj1nc'), Comment(id='m531gpg'), Comment(id='m4yx1l9'), Comment(id='m532ins')]","['A more reputable source has now published confirmation of this report.\n\nFluTrackers\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bird_Flu_Now/s/QiN92uN4Fd', 'Two pictures of normal-busy Chinese hospitals isn’t quite a source or proof.

Videos of crowded children’s hospitals across China have been circulating on social media platforms in recent days, with many children showing symptoms such as fever and cough. A netizen posted a video saying that the “flu” this winter is as powerful as the new coronavirus three years ago . All the hospital beds are occupied. Not only the pediatric department, but also the adult department is overcrowded. Many young and elderly people are infected and have fever.\n\nThere are also videos showing that in some hospitals’ pediatric departments, there are still many people queuing up for medical treatment late at night. Some parents even arrive at the hospital in the early morning to queue up for a number, and the infusion room is crowded with people. The Chinese Communist Party’s official media claimed that this wave of infection was caused by the outbreak of “H1N1”. However, many mainland netizens said that the symptoms of H1N1 are exactly the same as those of the new coronavirus. On December 25, the video blogger “Please Fei Ge” said that he and his wife went to Guangzhou to attend an event recently. After returning, they both had a fever, repeated high fevers, body aches, and headaches, just like the feeling of being positive that year. Later, it was learned that all 8 or 9 people who attended the event were infected with “A-type influenza”. In order to avoid infecting their children, he and his wife have been isolated for three days, and they still have a low-grade fever. He reminded everyone: “This feeling is exactly the same as when I got yang back then. It’s very uncomfortable. If you still remember that feeling, wear a mask when you go out in crowded places.” Many netizens on Chinese social platforms have reported that there have been collective infections among people around them. Netizen “色甘酸本色” said on Weibo on December 27: “A professor of infectious diseases at a hospital in a certain country gave a lecture and said that the number of patients in the fever clinic soared from 30 per day to 120 per day within a week. Of course, the good news is that the vast majority of patients who come here are ‘influenza A’. The bad news is that the symptoms of patients are often quite severe. The good news is that patients in the fever clinic generally do not need to be hospitalized. The bad news is that the positive rate of detection in hospitalized critically ill patients is also very high.” “Fang Naoke Deng Boyun” said: “All employees of the community bank have been infected with ‘H1N1’. What happened to the promise that financial industry workers would be the least affected after the opening up? My mother called the branch secretary of her former unit today to inquire about her retirement benefits. The branch secretary is lying at home with a fever. It’s not good to be a ‘lying-down cadre’.”\n\nThis pot is not that Hu. I just want to stretch my waist again.” said: “At least four offices in our unit have collectively laid down.” “Pottery Jar” said: “H1N1 is rampant in my workplace.” “The next door prince’s Weibo” said bluntly: “It’s COVID-19 positive.” Li Hongye, chief physician of women and children at Zhumadian Central Hospital, told Elephant News: “The flu has entered an outbreak period. According to the hospital’s epidemiological survey, the number of patients in December increased tenfold compared to November.” On December 27, Kan Biao, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference, “The recent upward trend in the positive detection rate of influenza viruses has been obvious. We have entered the seasonal epidemic period and will continue to rise for some time to come.” He also claimed that the new coronavirus infection is now at a relatively low epidemic level. The China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminds that human metapneumovirus has entered its peak period, and the symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory pathogen infections. There are currently no specific drugs or vaccines . Some netizens bluntly said that this was another outbreak of the “new crown”.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l16v4592nnae1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=377e93e26c89edac837a2719c206409e6a0da5c9', '[removed]', 'Here is the contact page for EconoTimes.

"hMPV outbreak in China, unconfirmed reports that hospitals are overwhelmed ",2024-12-30 19:16:14,20,https://m.phnompenhpost.com/national/public-health-alert-hmpv-outbreak-in-china-similar-to-flu-and-covid-19,"The Communicable Disease Control Department (CDC) of the Ministry of Health has issued a warning regarding the outbreak of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in China. The virus, which causes symptoms resembling those of the common cold and Covid-19, has seen a rise in infections, particularly among children.

“Dr. Chen Chih-jung of Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital stated in an interview on Thursday that hMPV is similar to respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], which primarily affects children under the age of two, whereas hMPV tends to infect older children,” the CDC noted.

According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC China), “Symptoms include cough, fever, nasal congestion and wheezing. Severe cases can result in bronchitis or pneumonia, particularly among infants, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.” 

The agency further noted that those with pre-existing lung conditions, such as asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or emphysema, are at higher risk of severe outcomes.

“The virus spreads primarily through droplets or aerosols from coughing or sneezing, as well as close contact or exposure to contaminated environments,” CDC China stated. “The incubation period ranges from three to five days.”

The National Disease Control and Prevention Administration in China has established protocols for laboratory reporting and case verification. 

“Data from December 16-22 indicates a rise in acute respiratory infections, including hMPV, particularly in northern provinces. Recent cases have predominantly involved individuals under 14 years of age,” according to Reuters.

“State broadcaster CCTV confirmed that respiratory infections this winter are largely attributed to the influenza virus, with hMPV also contributing,” the CDC added.

Despite the rising number of cases, experts emphasised caution in using antiviral drugs indiscriminately for hMPV, noting that “no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment exists” and that management should focus on alleviating symptoms.

The virus was first detected in 2001 by Dutch researchers in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from children with respiratory infections caused by unknown pathogens.

The CDC has issued several recommendations to curb the spread of hMPV and other respiratory illnesses. These include “wearing masks in crowded places, maintaining social distance, washing hands frequently and avoiding crowded areas whenever possible”.

Urgent Care Report: 3/16 - 3/20/2023,2023-03-24 00:43:55,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaCoronavirus/comments/11zu6r0/urgent_care_report_316_3202023/,"During what was a rather long stint of 5 days at the clinic, I was able to observe some patterns that are concerning.  

Firstly, the ""sinus congestion-turned pneumonia/asthma/mystery bronchitis"" that triggered serious illness in seniors has begun to feast upon the middle aged population, and occasionally some very young children.

I think I've hit upon what it is thanks to the viral surveillance data from the CDC: Human Metapnuemovirus. 

Check out the data table here: 

https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/hmpv/region.html

What symptoms does HMPV cause? **Cough, runny nose or nasal congestion, sore throat and fever.** More severe illness, with wheezing, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, cough, pneumonia, **and in adults, aggravation of asthma, also has been reported.**

As you can see from the above table, there's been a significant rise in cases recently. 

The other illness troubling our population is Norovirus. For a while we were seeing mostly children and teens, but now it's spread to the adult population, including seniors. 

See the CDC data table for Norovirus here: 

https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/norovirus/natl-trend.html

The rise (huge upward curve) shows just how nasty and easily transmitted Norovirus is. 

To get yourself well while suffering the effects, do not drink more than one or two swallows of water at a time. Your body can handle that. Gulping large quantities of water at a time will result in vomiting it all up, which is useless. A diluted mix of Pedialyte (1/2 water, 1/2 Pedialyte) will help with rehydration, too. Diluting it will negate the citric acid that is added for flavor, and might upset your stomach. 

Eating via the BRAT diet is recommended. Just one or two tablespoons/mouthfuls at a time of applesauce, bananas, plain rice, or toast will help coat your stomach. Yogurt in small quantities or a probiotic will help recolonize your good bacteria, helping your body to recover, too. 

For seriously sick patients (unable to keep *anything* down for 3 days): visit an Urgent Care or the ER. The patient may need an IV. There is a helpful medication called Odansetron (Oh-dance-eh-tron) which will reduce nausea. Talk to your practitioner about it if your vomiting is uncontrolled.

I have tried to ask patients if they ate at any particular establishments, or were at family get-togethers, but the answers seemed to elude them. They were so sick that they literally couldn't think straight. My thought is that it may have originated from cruise passengers who returned home with it. combined with school age children, who caught it from their peers, and infected their parents/family.

So how do you avoid both of the above viral illnesses? 

'1. Wear a good mask, correctly. That means over the nose, with good facial contact, no leaks. 

'2. Do not hug or kiss a sick child or adult. If someone is sick in your house, Wear a mask around them. Give them a bathroom to use that no one else uses. Seclude them to a bedroom. Clean sheets, common surfaces, etc. with bleach solution. 

'3. Wash your hands frequently *with soap*. Always wash before and after using the bathroom and before and after eating. Wash before prepping food, and after. 

Some of these steps are similar to isolation during COVID, and for good reasons. HMPV is a respiratory virus like COVID, and Norovirus is a food-borne and fecal contaminant virus. Both are highly transmissible.

.............

COVID has made a comeback at my clinic. We suddenly discovered small pockets of it, mostly in nuclear families. The other cases obviously originated from travel. The vast majority of cases were amongst visitors who came down from Northern states to visit family. They reported that they had been here for a week, and that they intended to leave in a week. Many were from Illinois, and some from Ohio and NY. 

We have been seeing problems at the pharmacies with prescriptions being on backorder - specifically the Zpac, Macrobid, and Benzonatate (antibiotics, UTI meds, and cough/sinus RXs).

There's also been a growing problem with all of our clinics: nurse shortages. We cannot seem to get anyone to sign on for open days. This suggests that they are happier at their ER jobs versus at our clinics.  I'm not sure of the reason for this - pay? Hours? Patient volume? New database learning curve? Still - each of our clinics are having to deal with lack of personnel. This weekend they decided to give us just one provider. So instead of two providers seeing about 30 - 35 patients each, we're seeing maybe 45 to 50 patients, stressing the provider and having to stop seeing patients from time to time because our schedule is just too full. The frustration is palpable - and has resulted in one of our best providers leaving within a week or two. That will put even more stress on those that stay. 

**It would be helpful if hospitalists could chime in on this! Are any of you seeing sudden changes/lack of nurses where you are?**

Since we will not see the data on COVID cases till Friday, I am hopeful that all of you will take steps to limit your exposure.

New virus strain suspected in Human metapneumovirus outbreak in China,2024-12-31 20:21:04,3,https://www-worldjournal-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.worldjournal.com/wj/amp/story/121474/8454542?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQIUAKwASCAAgM%3D#amp_ct=1735656123929&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17356560876442&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldjournal.com%2Fwj%2Fstory%2F121474%2F8454542,"Translation - China's National Administration for Disease Control and Prevention said at a press conference on the 27th that as cases of some respiratory diseases are expected to rise in winter, the agency is piloting active surveillance for pneumonia of unknown causes and will gradually promote it after it is improved. 

The latest monitoring results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that acute respiratory infectious diseases are on the rise in China, with mycoplasma viruses, syncytial viruses, etc. still at high levels, and the fluctuating rise in ""human metapneumovirus"" infections causing concern. **A patient became dizzy after being infected with the flu, and a ""new strain"" was suspected. Officials responded that it had not yet been found.**

According to reports from CCTV and Deutsche Welle, Lei Zhenglong, director of the Department of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control of the National Administration of Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference that in August this year, nine departments including the National Administration of Disease Control and Prevention jointly issued ""About Establishing and Improving Intelligent Multiple Points"". ""Guidance on Triggering the Infectious Disease Surveillance and Early Warning System"", the bureau has carried out surveillance of acute respiratory infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza in 1,041 sentinel hospitals, and has also selected some of these sentinel hospitals to conduct surveillance of a variety of common respiratory pathogens.

The National Administration of Disease Control and Prevention is piloting active surveillance for pneumonia of unknown origin and will gradually promote it after it is improved. In response to emerging infectious diseases, a pathogenic microorganism reporting catalog is being formulated to clarify laboratory reporting procedures and disease control agency verification and handling procedures. This laboratory network includes not only laboratories of disease control agencies, but also laboratories of medical and health institutions, third-party testing institutions, universities and scientific research institutes, and other relevant departments.


According to statistics from the ""Sentinel Surveillance of Acute Respiratory Infectious Diseases"" recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during the week from December 16 to 22, the overall infection rate of acute respiratory diseases showed an upward trend. Recent common cases include influenza Viruses and pathogens such as human metapneumovirus (also known as human metapneumovirus, HMPV). Among them, among cases aged 14 and under, the positive rate of human metapneumovirus shows a fluctuating upward trend, and the upward trend is more obvious in northern provinces.

Human metapneumovirus is not a new virus. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out in a popular science article in the past that the virus has global epidemic characteristics and does not respect national boundaries. Winter and spring are the highest incidence periods, and it is spread through droplets and contact. Common symptoms include upper respiratory tract infection symptoms such as cough, fever, nasal congestion and shortness of breath. After being infected with human metapneumovirus, patients are contagious from the end of the incubation period to the acute stage, but for most people it will not cause serious consequences, and symptoms will usually ease gradually in about a week.

Hu Yang, deputy chief physician of the Respiratory Department of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, recently stated that antiviral drugs should not be used blindly if infected with human metapneumovirus. Currently, there are no vaccines or specific drugs against human metapneumovirus in clinical practice, and treatment methods are mainly symptomatic.

The latest monitoring results from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention show that acute respiratory infectious diseases are on the rise in China, with mycoplasma viruses and syncytial viruses still at high levels, and influenza has also entered a seasonal epidemic period, but it is still lower than the level of the same period last year.

HMPV: China's Neighbors Respond Amid Virus Outbreak,2025-01-04 23:47:29,17,https://www.newsweek.com/hmpv-chinas-neighbors-respond-amid-virus-outbreak-2009734,"Several countries neighboring China have issued public health updates on human metapneumovirus (HMPV) amid a reported rise of the respiratory infection in China.

Newsweek has reached out to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and World Health Organization (WHO) Representative Office in China for comment via email.

Why It Matters
The reported increase in HMPV cases have sparked global concern, as recently there have been several cases reported outside of mainland China—in Hong Kong and Malaysia. Neither the Chinese government nor WHO have declared a public health emergency regarding the virus.

Five years ago, the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in China, and later impacted dozens of countries, becoming a global pandemic that has killed more than 7 million people. Several viruses, including bird flu, norovirus, and RSV, are circulating globally and in the U.S. Virus outbreaks pose public health risks by significantly impacting vulnerable populations and straining medical systems and resources.

[...] 

Recent news reports warn of a viral outbreak of HMPV in China, but U.S. and Chinese officials have yet to confirm this. Official reports from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that rates of multiple flu-like illnesses are on the rise in China, according to data up to the last week of 2024, and cases of HMPV infection had risen among people who are younger than 14 years old and living in northern provinces.

Several health officials from neighboring countries are issuing statements to quell concerns and note that the virus has been around in recent years and reminding residents there is always an uptick in respiratory illness during the colder seasons.

**What People Are Saying**

Dr. Atul Goel from the Directorate General of Health Services of India said on Friday, per India TV: ""There is news doing the rounds about a Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) outbreak in China. However, we have analysed the data of the respiratory outbreaks in the country (India) and there is no substantial increase in the December 2024 data and no cases which have been reported in large numbers from any of our institutions. There is nothing to be alarmed about the present situation.""

According to The Indian Express, India's Kerala state Health Minister Veena George said: ""Respiratory diseases especially in children and the elderly are being closely monitored. That apart, people coming from other countries, including China, will also be monitored if they develop respiratory symptoms. However, the present situation does not demand any restrictions for expatriates.""

The Malaysia Ministry of Health said in a Saturday statement, per the New Straits Times: ""This is not a new disease and in this country, hMPV infections are not required to be reported or notified according to the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.

The increase in acute respiratory infections at the end of the year and the beginning of the next is an expected phenomenon, consistent with similar trends reported in other countries, especially those experiencing colder seasons, such as China.

As a measure to prevent and control the spread of infections, the ministry is constantly monitoring from time to time, both domestically and internationally.""

According to the Pakistan's Samaa TV, Pakistan's Ministry of National Health Services ""has directed the National Institute of Health (NIH) to closely monitor the virus. A video link meeting involving health officials and medical experts has been scheduled to assess the situation and formulate a response strategy.""

**China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday, per The Independent: ""Respiratory infections tend to peak during the winter season. The diseases appear to be less severe and spread with a smaller scale compared to the previous year.""**

**What Happens Next**

The U.S. is continuing to grapple with high levels of respiratory illnesses, which typically spread more in colder months.

The CDC's respiratory illness forecast predicts that the COVID-19 season peak could occur later this season. Influenza typically peaks between December and February, while RSV's season peaks vary by region.","[Comment(id='m5eotlb'), Comment(id='m5ebzhs'), Comment(id='m5e2lgo'), Comment(id='m5jhi4x'), Comment(id='m5hos1l'), Comment(id='m5ee8df'), Comment(id='m5eeuwy'), Comment(id='m5qhzbv'), Comment(id='m5efg7l'), Comment(id='m5h7vd2'), Comment(id='m5qupn9'), Comment(id='m5eipe2'), Comment(id='m5fsdtt'), Comment(id='m5f2c15'), Comment(id='m5gpizm'), Comment(id='m5i1ee9'), Comment(id='m5f2g5f')]","['Statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning from Regular Press Conference on January 3, 2025 for those interested in reading the full exchange.

We don’t have any cases of this virus in India, and it’s not as dangerous as it sounds. Unfortunately, social media has a way of blowing things out of proportion, making people more anxious than necessary. Instead of worrying, let’s focus on what we can do: follow basic hygiene practices, like washing our hands and covering our mouths when we cough or sneeze. And most importantly, trust reliable sources for updates rather than getting caught up in fear-driven posts online. Staying calm and informed is the best way forward.

HMPV: China's New Virus Outbreak Explained,2025-01-03 19:31:02,13,https://www.newsweek.com/human-metapneumovirus-hmpv-china-outbreak-explainer-2009126,"News reports and social media posts are warning of a new outbreak of a little-known virus called human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China, but officials are yet to confirm this.

Instead, official reports from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that rates of multiple flu-like illnesses are on the rise in China, according to data up to the last week of 2024.

That data suggests that influenza is leading the outbreak, with 30.2 percent of tests coming back positive for it—an increase of 6.2 from the previous week—and 17.7 percent of people hospitalized with a severe respiratory illness testing positive for it.

However, that same dataset indicates that rates of HMPV are ahead of other flu-like diseases—such as COVID-19, rhinovirus and adenovirus—linked to 6.2 percent of positive respiratory illness tests and 5.4 percent of respiratory-illness hospitalizations in China.

What Is HMPV?

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus that can cause flu-like illness in people of all ages, although some people are more at risk, including young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.

The virus was only discovered as recently as 2001, but it is in the same family as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): another flu-like virus.

The more widespread use of testing for specific viruses among people with flu-like symptoms has resulted in an increased awareness of HMPV as a significant cause of respiratory illnesses.

How does HMPV spread?

Like other similar viruses, HMPV usually spreads from person to person through droplets from coughing and sneezing, through human contact such as hugging or kissing, and through touching surfaces and objects contaminated with the virus and then the mouth, nose or eyes.

In the U.S., HMPV circulates seasonally alongside the flu and similar diseases, and is most active in late winter and spring.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends several ways Americans can protect themselves from the virus: washing hands often with soap and water, avoid touching the face with unwashed hands and avoid close contact with sick people.

People with flu-like symptoms are advised to cover their mouth when coughing or sneezing, wash their hands frequently with soap and water, avoid sharing cups and cutlery with others, avoid kissing others and stay at home to recover.

**Could This Lead to Another Pandemic?**

Because HMPV is a virus that was recognized relatively recently, there is no specific treatment available for it and no available vaccine.

People with HMPV are advised to treat it like the flu and to stay at home while the body fights off infection.

Currently, there is not enough information from reliable sources on the extent and severity of a possible HMPV outbreak in China to accurately predict the risk of a pandemic.

However, this is a virus that already circulates among populations in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, so there is more herd immunity against it than there would be against a novel virus, such as COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic.","[Comment(id='m56uf42'), Comment(id='m5b4kkh'), Comment(id='m5cgido'), Comment(id='m5azhrd'), Comment(id='m5z5ryl'), Comment(id='m9tmosz'), Comment(id='m57sj89'), Comment(id='m5ciqvv'), Comment(id='m5b1ubn'), Comment(id='m5b1acb'), Comment(id='m57vzz8'), Comment(id='m5dltif'), Comment(id='m5925o3')]","['How about wearing a mask?

Covid Chronicles: 02/09/2025,2025-02-10 03:15:30,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaCoronavirus/comments/1ilq4x1/covid_chronicles_02092025/,"My apologies for not attending to the Covid front sooner. I am afraid that I have been mired down by the political warfare that has recently affected many of us. 

I would normally endeavor to try to keep politics to a minimum, as this is supposed to be a health oriented, anti-infection related report for everyone. Hoooowwwever: One can barely discuss infectious rates without noting the immense changes that have been forced upon the departments of government and institutions that have (for the most part) been about saving lives and preventing infectious disease.

First off, I started by attending the panel that questioned RFK Jr. prior to the confirmation vote by The House Finance Committee of The Senate. It was a sorry state of affairs, and despite the angry grilling he received, the mountains of history and evidence filed, he was still confirmed for the position of Secretary of the HHS (Department of Health and Human Services).
You can still watch the whole thing here: 
https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/open-executive-session-to-consider-favorably-reporting-the-nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-of-california-to-be-secretary-of-health-and-human-services

That was painful. My favorite quote was: 

>""The last thing we need is a dilettante, a *dilettante*, dabbling in conspiracy theories...at HHS.""
Senator Warnock (Georgia Democrat). 

Definition: dilettante: a person who is or seems to be interested in a subject, but whose understanding of it is not very deep or serious.

I was intrigued by the statements of Sen. Warren (Democrat, Massachusetts): 
She discussed the fact that RFK Jr. switched his earnings from anti-vax lawsuits to his son, and stated that the day after he leaves his position he will then continue to take in money from said lawsuits. He has already earned $2 million via the anti-vaxx lawsuits. 

When grilled as to whether RFK Jr..is anti-vaxx, he replied carefully that he ""Would not touch children's vaxx schedules"". Other than that, he was unwilling to discuss it except to repeat ""I am not anti-vaxx.""

I have heard so many claims from RFK Jr , including the now famous: 

>“We’ve devoted all of these dollars to infectious disease and to drug development and very little to chronic disease.” 

>“The real threat to human health is not coming from infections,” 

And: 

>He said WHO “fabricated the 2006 bird flu outbreak, which of course never happened, but the pharma industry made $20 billion on a vaccine that of course didn’t work and there was no pandemic.”

Let's not forget that he blamed Lyme Disease on a leak from Plum Island, in NY. 

Oh, dear. This is our new Secretary of the HHS. Folks, we're in trouble. 

I was even more amazed that Sen. Tillis (Republican, North Carolina) expressed the reason why he voted yes: The Dept. of Agriculture, farmers, etc. failed to say anything about RFK Jr. He said that he was interested in letting him ""Go wild, (as Trump put it) on Medicaid, school food programs, prescription costs, and medical supply chains.""

We have Lutheran Hospitals and clinics here in Florida that are non-denominational centers of health and healing.The services are free or heavily discounted. Communities *need* these medical facilities. The whole situation is hard to believe. 

For a brief time, both Medicare and Medicaid were unreachable accross the country, pausing medical services for uncounted millions of patients:

Thankfully a judge stopped this: 

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/second-judge-blocks-trump-federal-aid-funding-freeze-rcna190249

I will not go into some of the other things that have been committed because they are too heinous, too inhuman to speak of (they regard sexuality, racial origin, eugenics, and religion). I will note that VA, Medicare, Worker's Compensation patients, and Medicaid recipients have had their medical records pried into, and in some cases shared online - which is a clear violation of personal information. To say that I have been horrified by this is an understatement.

I want to take this opportunity to give you the tools to prevent this:

(Note the blurb at the top). Download the instructions before they disappear, people. 

...............................................................

The Covid numbers: 

01/03:  3,462

01/10:  3,923

01/17:  3,453

01/24:  4,007

01/31:  3556 - this number is temporary and could rise or fall by next week.

Covid is actually falling in the Tampa area wastewater. However, Influenza is still high, HMPV (Human Metapneumovirus) is very, very high, RSV is low, and Norovirus is high. 

The combination of these viruses and government interference are reaking havoc on our local ERs, which have gone to OLMC (Online Medical Command) at least once for the Tampa North Region. Expect further problems for at least another month, as we transition from Winter to Spring, and who knows what may happen on the political side of Medicare, Disability, VA and Medicaid insurances.

I need not caution all of you to mask up, and wash your hands frequently, right? Good. 

..............................................................

I'd just like to say to all of you: Please be careful in these uncertain times. While I have seen egg hoarding at my local supermarkets, apparently new restrictions are slowly being put in place. 

Take caution with ALL MEAT and DAIRY that you consume. Cook everything thoroughly, and do some prepping: 

Buy staples such as rice and beans, lentils, canned broths, canned soups, canned meats, milk and such. If it is hard on your budget, buy just one extra item each week. 

Don't forget to put MASKS on your shopping list. A good supply would be enough for at least a few weeks. They may become in short supply soon, as tariffs take hold. 

PLEASE PRACTICE BIOSECURITY IN THE HOME. See the above CDC link. Become familiar with shoes for indoors (nice slippers) and shoes for outdoors (sneakers, boots, dress shoes). If you need to store shoes that have been used outdoors in your closet, thoroughly disinfect them before storage. (Lysol is your friend.)

My recommendation for families with children and pets: Stay away from parks with open, grassy fields that are frequented by geese, ducks, hawks, or crows. 

Stay away from ponds or creeks that are frequented by geese, ducks, or any wild aquatic birds. 

Be mindful of areas where birds wander: sidewalks, yards and paths included. 

Buy antiviral wipes for your dog's feet. Wipe before entering the house after walks or forays in the backyard. 

Empty anything that gathers rainwater in your backyard, and do not allow dogs to drink from puddles or accumulated water. 

Never handle a sick bird. Never. Report it to your local wildlife authority. 

Please, try to STAY SAFE.

HI-RES 240 megapixel scans of IMAX Film Cells!,2023-09-20 11:35:01,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/imax/comments/16ndmfi/hires_240_megapixel_scans_of_imax_film_cells/,"EDIT\*\*SWITCHED TO A GOOGLE DRIVE LINK\*\*

Thank you for everyone's patience! 

I shared some photos of some of my IMAX cells projected on a projector and was asked for the TIF files themselves. Well here they are! Each file was about 2GB in data size, measuring 17000k in dimension. It took 10-15mins for each one to upload and there are 26 photos in the folder, so you can imagine it took a very long time. These were all scanned with an Epson v550 (a very reliable scanner, though I hope to upgrade to an 800 or 850 soon) and retouched in Lightroom. I referred to a digital copy of the film to try and match the white balance and colors as best as I could. My IMAX film cell collection contains thousands of cells, so this folder contains some of the images I projected as well as a few others I felt like throwing in. There are shots from The Dark Knight, Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises in here.

I'm not claiming these to be the best scans in the world, but they're still beauties nonetheless. Enjoy!

\*\*EDIT\*\* So sorry, the links are still suspended. I spoke with Dropbox again and they said the ban will lift in 24hrs. Since they went down around 9AM PST, expect them to be working again around that time tomorrow.

\*\*ALSO NOTE\*\* These won't open or download on a phone, it's best to download and view on a PC or MAC. Imagine trying to view something of uncompressed IMAX quality on a phone, it just won't work. I've also uploaded JPG alternatives which SHOULD be able to be viewed on your phone with faster download times.

Covid Chronicles: 1/4/2025,2025-01-05 06:39:25,8,https://i.redd.it/tq8gfcfcs2be1.png,"The big story that has just about scared Bird Flu watchers and Covid haters senseless is the HMPV (Human MetaPnuemoVirus) outbreak in Northern China. 

This virus was first discovered in 2001, but has probably been around for at least 70 years. 2001 was when it was found by some researchers in the Netherlands. 

HMPV is therefore incorrectly being labeled by the media as ""an unknown pneumonia"", causing a bit of hysteria. 

Guess what? We've got it right here in Florida. In fact, Tampa is blowing up with it. See the picture above, from our own wastewater. 

It adores both kids (mostly under 5 yrs) and seniors (mostlybiver 65 yrs), and is a post-infection or co-infection of Influenza A. 

So...if you're a senior who has had both the Flu and Pneumonia vaccines, you shouldn't be fearing for your life. You're probably going to be okay. 

Kids on the other hand - if they have not had their Flu vaccine, (and there is no Pneumonia vaccine for them) - may end up with the flu, and then this type of pneumonia. It's dreadful, and there is no antiviral for it. It's going to be a miserable few weeks before kids who catch it can go back to school. 

Isolation and supportive treatment are the norm for HMPV. Lots of liquids, analgesics, humidified air, and hot soup. If you have an O2 reader from the early days of Covid, here's your chance to use it. Some kids can look and sound pretty bad (they can have trouble breathing) so at least keeping tabs on their O2 can help determine how they're doing. Breathing treatments and steroids can help, so if their 02 is low, get them to a doctor. And urgent care that has an X-ray can also check their lungs. 

The Cleveland Center has a good overview of it: 

https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22443-human-metapneumovirus-hmpv

If your kid has the flu, there are antivirals that can help, and hopefully, keep HMPV from taking advantage of their weakened condition. 

…………...................................................

As we expected, Covid is rearing its ugly head after the holidays. Here are the stats from hospital testing of residents only: 

12/06:  2,468

12/13:  2,669

12/20:  2,674

12/27:  3,151 - **Updated to 3,297 on Saturday, 1/4/25**

Note: They posted incorrectly, and changed 12/20 from 2500 to **2674**. Grrrrrr! The inaccuracy astounds me. 

This basically means that the 3151 that they've posted today may be an undercount. I'm guessing it is. Frustrating! This is something that we've come to expect, but it really grinds my gears! 

We should know more next Friday/Saturday, of course. 

Also keep in mind, Flu and Covid can co-infect - you can have both at the same time, so do take care of yourselves, wear a mask - and get vaccinated if you can! You can avoid all of the above, including HMPV with a good resirator style mask. 

Please remember hand washing with soap and water, especially with Norovirus being around too. 

Be well!

You're probably going to be okay. \n\nI’m not sure if you’re trying to say that the pneumococcal (“pneumonia”) vaccines will protect against HMPV pneumonia—it won’t. That vaccine protects against a specific bacterial cause of pneumonia that often occurs secondarily to viral infections but, unfortunately, it doesn’t help with viral infections themselves. \n\nWe also don’t know how effective the flu shot is this season. It’s too early in the Northern Hemisphere season to have usable data but, [per CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7339a1.htm), in the Southern Hemisphere VE was around 35%. Not the greatest even by flu vaccine standards but it’s still always better to get vaccinated than to skip it.\n\n>Kids on the other hand…there is no Pneumonia vaccine for them\n\nKids under 5 are supposed to get full series of the Hib and pneumococcal vaccines both of which protect against bacteria which are common causes of pneumonia (along with meningitis and sepsis). Again, though, neither of these will protect against pneumonia caused by HMPV"", ""This amazes me! Why are we not informed about this child pneumonia vaccine in FL? I know it's pretty uniform, so I'm guessing it's our lovely Ladapo, crushing vaccine info as usual. \n\nHere is the schedule for children under 6 yrs:\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/child-easyread.html\n\nHasn't vaccination become amazing!? The thing about this is that kids need to see their pediatrician often, and the kids I saw (and their parents) were entirely unaware of the vaccines their kids (under 6) had gotten. Since my Urgent Care no longer had a clinical member that was registered to update vaccine records, we stopped accepting vaccine record cards for kids getting school physicals. \n\nThe fact that kids (hopefully) have been armed with lots of antibodies against Flu and bacterial pneumonia also cheers me - but parents need to be very wary. With kids in daycare it's going to be rough, and parents need to be responsible about spreading illnesses within their toddler's circles.   \n\nYou're right. Having a flu shot and pneumonia shot is the same as getting a Covid shot: they are not wholly preventative. Viral pneumonia is a tricky customer. \n\nBut having these shots and *mask wearing* really *does* cut the infection rate, no matter which way you look at it. *Not* getting the Flu (or having a milder infection, teamed up with Tamivir) will spare most seniors from bacterial pneumonia, community spread pneumonia, walking pneumonia, and viral pneumonias like HMPV. \n\n(Just remember seniors: Going on those care-free maskless cruises will virtually *guarantee* that you come home with *something*.)\n\nYou should know that the readers of this subreddit are staunchly aware that mask wearing and proper hand hygiene are the two big tools in our arsenal against catching the viruses that plague us. \n\nWe tend to work in tandem with the r/zerocovidcommunity to keep people aware, and help those with few options protect themselves. \n\nVery happy to have you here to help. We have very few Pediatricians in this sub, and as you can tell, I am distinctly behind the times. I need to do more research in future posts.\n\nDo give us your input more often!""]"

Bùng Phát Virus Mới Metapneumovirus Ở Trung Quốc Sau 5 Năm COVID-19: Tuyên Bố Khẩn Cấp !!,2025-01-03 15:34:11,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TroChuyenLinhTinh/comments/1hsj7bh/bùng_phát_virus_mới_metapneumovirus_ở_trung_quốc/,"**Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV)** là một loại virus thuộc họ **Paramyxoviridae**, lần đầu tiên được phát hiện vào năm 2001. Đây là một trong những nguyên nhân chính gây ra các bệnh nhiễm trùng đường hô hấp, đặc biệt ở trẻ em, người cao tuổi, và những người có hệ miễn dịch suy yếu.

# Đặc điểm của Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV):

1. **Triệu chứng:**
   * hMPV thường gây ra các triệu chứng giống như cảm lạnh hoặc cúm, bao gồm:
      * Ho, sốt, sổ mũi, nghẹt mũi.
      * Trong trường hợp nặng, có thể gây viêm phổi hoặc viêm tiểu phế quản.
      * Thở khò khè và khó thở, đặc biệt ở trẻ nhỏ hoặc người già.
2. **Đối tượng dễ bị ảnh hưởng:**
   * Trẻ em dưới 5 tuổi.
   * Người cao tuổi, đặc biệt những người sống trong viện dưỡng lão.
   * Người có hệ miễn dịch yếu, ví dụ: bệnh nhân ung thư, người ghép tạng.
3. **Cách lây lan:**
   * Qua giọt bắn khi ho hoặc hắt hơi.
   * Tiếp xúc trực tiếp với người nhiễm bệnh hoặc bề mặt bị nhiễm virus.
4. **Phòng ngừa và điều trị:**
   * Hiện tại chưa có vắc-xin hoặc thuốc đặc trị cho hMPV.
   * Điều trị chủ yếu là giảm triệu chứng: nghỉ ngơi, uống nhiều nước, hạ sốt và dùng thuốc theo chỉ dẫn của bác sĩ.

# Tình hình tại Trung Quốc:

Nếu có báo cáo về đợt bùng phát hMPV mới tại Trung Quốc, đây có thể là một sự gia tăng bất thường về số ca nhiễm hoặc biến thể mới gây ra nguy cơ nghiêm trọng hơn. Điều này sẽ cần các cơ quan y tế công cộng tăng cường giám sát và ứng phó để kiểm soát dịch bệnh.","[Comment(id='m5b3dok'), Comment(id='m56f6jn'), Comment(id='m56gg47'), Comment(id='m57pd25'), Comment(id='m5cndry'), Comment(id='m55xq1h'), Comment(id='m564ml0'), Comment(id='m55t4xk'), Comment(id='m56cg0z'), Comment(id='m56n76u'), Comment(id='m589npe'), Comment(id='m577f1m'), Comment(id='m571xot'), Comment(id='m55szcs'), Comment(id='m55t23q'), Comment(id='m5b6mn7'), Comment(id='m5cov1i'), Comment(id='m55tkjh'), Comment(id='m55uh7v'), Comment(id='m56pzp7'), Comment(id='m55v4lc'), Comment(id='m55v2ma'), Comment(id='m55wxfq'), Comment(id='m5634e4')]","['Ah fu\\*k, not this shit again.\n\nT có nghe trên China Insider with David Zhang![img](emote|t5_4bcops|22267)', 'Tình hình chiến tranh toàn cầu\n\nCác phòng thí nghiệm sinh học liên tục thử nghiệm thuốc chống dịch bệnh bằng cách tạo ra mẫu …\n\nNên c19 chưa hề là đại dịch cuối cùng nhé\n\nPhật cũng đã dạy về những điều tương tự ở cõi này, chú muốn biết có thể tìm các cao tăng để hỏi', 'ah shit, here we go again', 'Cảnh này thật quen thuộc,\n\n![img](emote|t5_4bcops|22267)![img](emote|t5_4bcops|22267)![img](emote|t5_4bcops|22267)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9sau3svetae1.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=b25b77be9673cf3953efd6419328391075d3167c', 'Đụ mẹ cứ mỗi lần ông Trump lên là tụi tàu nó lại đổ bịnh ![img](emote|t5_4bcops|22267) đúng người đúng thời điểm vãi lònnnnn', 'Gì ghê z mày ![img](emote|t5_4bcops|27380)', 'Đù má đói nhăn răng khỉ ![img](emote|t5_4bcops|22263)', 'có khi nào trở về thời 2019-2021 không nhỉ', 'cũng nhục, tung của đã ít trẻ em rồi còn dính quả này', 't mới gg thấy 2023 có rồi mà', 'Nghe nói đợt countdown vừa rồi ko có bắn pháo bông ở Thượng Hải.

Has anybody had this virus?? Human Metapneumovirus?,2024-10-26 02:16:52,146,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1gc4bxt/has_anybody_had_this_virus_human_metapneumovirus/,"Hi Everybody,

  
I've posted in r/health and r/Australia and I wanted to ask reddit about individual stories or experiences to make me feel a little at ease. I've been having a rough go of it the last 3 weeks. The first week I was quite ill and had no idea why, was admitted to hospital and done all the tests and they somehow SOMEHOW missed the viral infection. It was only when I was told they couldn't do anything for me and discharged, I insisted and I went to my GP the next day, did another blood screening and was diagnosed with HMPV. 

  
So okay, the GP tells me over the phone I had HMPV and that's why I felt so ill last week. I thought, sure, I am feeling loads better now. (Apparently, due to my internet sleuthing, this is very common and called a refractory period of the virus) The internet says that HMPV only lasts 5-12 days for a healthy individual... I should be over the large hump. Boy, was I very, very fucking wrong. 

  
Then the virus hits me like a ton of bricks. I start feeling like I'm actually dying. I develop pneumonia in both lungs - upper and lower infection. I couldn't talk without wheezing and coughing. Admitted to hospital again and at this point, they do everything they say they can ""possibly"" do for me... of course, I know this is true. It's a viral infection with no anti-viral medicine and no vaccine but at the time, I was very frustrated. It didn't feel like any infection I'd ever had in my life, including COVID. I've had COVID twice, this was nothing compared to it.

They gave me antibiotics for the pneumonia over the drip and then when it started to clear, discharged me. I am now on week 3... still in bed, still coughing, still feeling like absolute death. Has anybody had this virus and if so, how long did it take you to get over it? It feels dismissive when I see normal google search results say 12 days but from some people I've spoken to, it took much longer. Can anybody share their stories?","[Comment(id='ltr9crg'), Comment(id='ltrpg4h'), Comment(id='ltrkme3'), Comment(id='ltrvs4i'), Comment(id='ltrrj91'), Comment(id='ltr8rsz'), Comment(id='ltt2bmg'), Comment(id='ltr52uy'), Comment(id='ltrx1za'), Comment(id='ltrxp84'), Comment(id='ltrv4zn'), Comment(id='ltrvsmg'), Comment(id='ltrz0bg'), Comment(id='ltrzdrk'), Comment(id='ltsca1l'), Comment(id='ltt1o8v'), Comment(id='lttb4gm'), Comment(id='lttetha'), Comment(id='ltxvas5'), Comment(id='lu2g8kb'), Comment(id='m5hebmn'), Comment(id='m5o5bv4'), Comment(id='m5ogoch'), Comment(id='ltsh2zd'), Comment(id='ltsolgq'), Comment(id='lttoy9c'), Comment(id='lttufpu'), Comment(id='ltu2nq9'), Comment(id='ltuuecc'), Comment(id='lugeqka'), Comment(id='lzjkdrf'), Comment(id='lzjmwjh'), Comment(id='m56wymh'), Comment(id='m5c4mng'), Comment(id='ltr9yaf'), Comment(id='ltrqnel'), Comment(id='ltrq5b8'), Comment(id='lts44tg'), Comment(id='ltrsany'), Comment(id='ltrnffw'), Comment(id='ltr9dq9'), Comment(id='ltt34lb'), Comment(id='ltxjagj'), Comment(id='ltt2zg1'), Comment(id='ltr5r3s'), Comment(id='ltr6d9a'), Comment(id='ltr716d'), Comment(id='ltrz4nk'), Comment(id='ltrycnp'), Comment(id='lts4gnc'), Comment(id='ltrzci0'), Comment(id='lts57gu'), Comment(id='ltsvjnu'), Comment(id='ltt26td'), Comment(id='ltt23kp'), Comment(id='ltthl4s'), Comment(id='ltthdzm'), Comment(id='ltthqiz'), Comment(id='ltthv91'), Comment(id='lu2c7ji'), Comment(id='lu2gycf'), Comment(id='m663s3x'), Comment(id='ltsvy9y'), Comment(id='lxw4rqj'), Comment(id='ltsw3jm'), Comment(id='ltwmixs'), Comment(id='ltwn1xa'), Comment(id='ltwnb0u'), Comment(id='ltwo31l'), Comment(id='ltwp1xt'), Comment(id='ltwp89m'), Comment(id='lugzj19'), Comment(id='lzt4olm'), Comment(id='lzmahtb'), Comment(id='lzt3tz6'), Comment(id='m5c4tgt'), Comment(id='m5f3ibn'), Comment(id='ltrqau2'), Comment(id='lts4r3s'), Comment(id='ltt3leo'), Comment(id='ltrr33f'), Comment(id='ltsuvyr'), Comment(id='lu1vy10'), Comment(id='lu1xma7'), Comment(id='ltrumi3'), Comment(id='ltr6vwf'), Comment(id='ltrdcse'), Comment(id='lts6bl5'), Comment(id='lts14vk'), Comment(id='ltsbiue'), Comment(id='lttjf21'), Comment(id='lttjjtx'), Comment(id='ltsy1mg'), Comment(id='ltx5gqw'), Comment(id='ltwzsx7'), Comment(id='m5c4ynb'), Comment(id='ltrr6ep'), Comment(id='lts9est'), Comment(id='ltt3wfp'), Comment(id='lttis5u'), Comment(id='lu25p3p'), Comment(id='lyvmylj'), Comment(id='lu2az9y'), Comment(id='lttogx7'), Comment(id='lts4tuz'), Comment(id='ltsuf6y'), Comment(id='lts9mgp'), Comment(id='lts964o'), Comment(id='ltsv8x9'), Comment(id='ltwkcfs'), Comment(id='ltwllx7'), Comment(id='ltt1bnv'), Comment(id='ltt0jbm'), Comment(id='ltxsdw6'), Comment(id='ltx52wo'), Comment(id='m5f44wx'), Comment(id='ltrrn0u'), Comment(id='ltsfk9v'), Comment(id='ltwq5j4'), Comment(id='lu5m1iy'), Comment(id='lu2dkcv'), Comment(id='lu2b8sz'), Comment(id='ltwspaj'), Comment(id='ltu82mj'), Comment(id='ltwrbjh'), Comment(id='ltt98py'), Comment(id='ltt1rlm'), Comment(id='ltt1k99'), Comment(id='m5gj1su'), Comment(id='lu3jco5'), Comment(id='ltwrojm'), Comment(id='ltth4ig'), Comment(id='ltt2j2h'), Comment(id='ltt1pvx'), Comment(id='lu4riso'), Comment(id='ltti343'), Comment(id='ltt3hlc'), Comment(id='ltti7qd'), Comment(id='ltt3rg6'), Comment(id='lubnyny'), Comment(id='luc6w3i'), <MoreComments count=0, children=[]>]","[""Family's had it recently - gave a toddler pneumonia and put them in hospital.

You probably had a week of feeling better as you recovered from the hmpv while the second infection incubated, and then you subsequently got sicker. \nThe fact that you are still feeling ill probably means you are suffering from the lasting inflammation in your lungs from the pneumonia (takes 4-6 weeks post pneumonia to completely resolve) but if you’re still feeling crap consider heading back to your Gp for a progress chest X-ray and /or viral swab', 'My mother (70ish) had it about 6 weeks ago.

Как вирусы конкурируют друг с другом. Грипп проиграл СOVID-19? Куда пропал «сезон простуд» во время пандемии ковида и ждать ли его обратно?,2021-04-01 06:39:25,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Popular_Science_Ru/comments/mhka3j/как_вирусы_конкурируют_друг_с_другом_грипп/," **Пандемия ковида длится уже больше года. Теперь, стоит кому-нибудь кашлянуть, и мы сразу подозреваем коронавирусную болезнь, никаких больше «просто простыл». И на это есть основания: грипп и другие привычные респираторные болезни в 2020 году будто бы отступили. Они что, тоже пострадали от пандемии ковида?**

Простуды и грипп — сезонные болезни: осенью и зимой мы болеем ими чаще, чем летом. Но эпидемический сезон 2020-2021 выдался особенным.

В Северном полушарии сезон гриппа начинается в районе октября и может длиться до апреля или мая. Но по данным ВОЗ, на конец 2020 года на нашем конце земного шара активность гриппа [находилась](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/covid-19-measures-also-suppress-flu-now) на таком же низком уровне, как и летом. То есть сезон простуд будто бы не начался.

По данным американского Центра по контролю и предотвращению заболеваний (CDC), в этом сезоне с жалобами, похожими на грипп, в больницы США обратилось гораздо меньше людей, чем в прошлом. На графике хорошо видно, что в сезон 2020-2021 заболеваемость гриппом упала до 0,9 процентов населения страны — это гораздо ниже базового уровня в 2,6 процентов, рассчитанного за семь сезонов подряд. Такого не было десять лет. 

В Южном полушарии сезон гриппа начинается в апреле и длится до сентября. Но и здесь в 2020 году было то же самое: заболеваемость гриппом [снизилась](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937a6.htm) во всех трех странах, где ведется мониторинг — в Австралии, Чили и в ЮАР.

В апреле-июле 2020 года в Австралии только 33 из 60 031 тестов на грипп оказались положительными. В Чили — 12 из 21 178, а в ЮАР — 6 из 2098. Всего 51 положительный образец из 83 307 на три страны — это 0,06 процента. Для сравнения, в предыдущие четыре года в эти же месяцы положительными оказались 24 512 из 178 690 образцов, то есть 13 процентов. 

Других вирусных болезней в зимний сезон 2020-2021 годов тоже стало меньше. По сравнению с предыдущим годом, передача простудного респираторно-синцитиального вируса (RSV) в США [снизилась](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30547) как минимум на 20 процентов. А вспышки редкого и очень тяжелого заболевания позвоночника, напоминающего полиомиелит — острого вялого миелита — [и вовсе не было](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/puww-ooa030921.php), хотя она случается каждые два года и должна была вернуться в США в 2020 году.

## Кто кого заборет

Когда вы заболеваете «очередной простудой», врач, как правило, может поставить диагноз: это или ОРВИ, или грипп, или ковид (который, строго говоря, тоже ОРВИ, но пока что у нас на особом счету). Эти болезни имеют схожую природу и атакуют нас примерно одинаково — передаются воздушно-капельным путем, инфицируют клетки дыхательных путей, пробираются в легкие. А это значит, что между ними идет самая настоящая конкуренция за «кормовую базу» — нас с вами.

При этом разные простудные вирусы взаимодействуют друг с другом по-разному. То, будут вирусы «бороться» друг с другом до победного конца, или попытаются ужиться в одном организме, зависит от множества причин.

**Скорость размножения вируса.** У нас [есть](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155589) данные, что при одновременном заражении в борьбе за клетки, как правило, побеждает тот вирус, который [быстрее размножается](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26098). «Быстрый» вирус эффективнее захватывает клетки, так что его «медленному» сопернику просто не хватает ресурсов для успешного размножения. В результате быстрый вирус подавляет размножение более медленного.

**Порядок проникновения в организм.** Если один вирус начинает размножаться в клетках до появления другого, он получает беспрепятственный доступ ко всем клеткам-мишеням — то есть оказывается в лучших условиях и получает преимущество перед тем, кто придет следом. Исследователи [установили](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155589.g006), что первоначальная риновирусная инфекция может блокировать последующую инфекцию респираторно-синцитиальным вирусом. Это работает и наоборот: если человек сначала заражается респираторно-синцитиальным вирусом, тот подавит более позднюю риновирусную инфекцию.

**Количество вирусных частиц, которые попали в организм.** Если разные вирусы попали в организм одновременно, преимущество получает тот вирус, в «порции» которого было больше частиц. Большое количество вирусных «солдат» позволяет быстрее захватить больше клеток и получить преимущество перед конкурентом.

**Время проникновения в клетку.** В одну и ту же клетку способны внедриться два разных вируса. Но то, станет ли вирус-«пришелец» подавлять размножение вируса-«туземца», зависит от того, через какое время «пришелец» попадает в клетку. [Исследование](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10989700/) показало, что, если вирус гриппа А проникал в клетку одновременно с респираторно-синцитиальным вирусом, то он блокировал размножение последнего. А если вирус гриппа попадал в клетку через 12 часов после того, как там уже устроился респираторно-синцитиальный вирус, то грипп уже не мог повлиять на его рост.

[ Как меняется титр различных вирусных инфекций в зависимости от того, в одиночестве они захватывают клетки организма или в паре с каким-то еще патогеном. Вирусы: парагрипп \(PIV\), респираторно-синцитиальный вирус \(RSV\), риновирус \(hRV\), метапневмовирус \(hMPV\), вирус гриппа А \(IAV\). Lubna Pinky, Hana M. Dobrovolny \/ PLOS \/ CC BY-SA 4.0](https://preview.redd.it/qurh3a2qngq61.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=095c0077237d2a4a0689894d66acba206d5520c4)

 Однако при определенных условиях разные вирусы могут уживаться друг с другом. Один и тот же пациент [может заразиться](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/38/3/739) и гриппом, и ОРВИ. Более того — разные вирусы могут размножаться в одной клетке. Совместное заражение разными, даже неродственными вирусами может привести к тому, что они не только «подружатся», но и [обменяются генетическим материалом](https://cmr.asm.org/content/31/4/e00111-17.long) — так что в результате получатся химерные вирусы.

Поскольку факторов, воздействующих на поведение вирусов, очень много, предсказать, чем окончится битва коронавируса с гриппом и простудными вирусами, очень тяжело. О том, как коронавирус SARS-CoV-2 взаимодействует с конкурентами, мы пока знаем очень мало.

Например, пока не понятно, может ли коронавирус сосуществовать с вирусом гриппа в одной клетке. В принципе, это возможно. И грипп, и коронавирус используют для проникновения в клетку [разные рецепторы](https://asm.org/Articles/2020/July/COVID-19-and-the-Flu), так что конкуренции в этом вопросе между ними быть не должно. Кроме того, клетки альвеол II типа, которые предпочитает SARS-CoV-2, являются [основным местом репликации](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00473-1) вируса гриппа А. Но означает ли это, что при совместной инфекции оба вируса занимают именно эти клетки, мы пока не знаем.

Тем не менее, кое-какие предварительные выводы сделать все-таки можно. Хотя случаи совместного заражения одного человека коронавирусом и другими вирусами [действительно известны](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2764787), они встречаются реже, чем случаи совместного заражения другими респираторными вирусами. Это [может значить](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26098), что либо SARS-CoV-2 подавляет размножение большинства других респираторных вирусов, либо размножение SARS-CoV-2 подавляется присутствием других вирусов.

Существуют модели, которые оценивают, у какого вируса выше шанс победить — у коронавируса, гриппа или одного из многочисленных возбудителей ОРВИ. Главный фактор, от которого зависит победа — скорость размножения вируса в клетке. Согласно [формуле](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841722/), которая применялась для расчета скорости размножения предыдущих вирусных инфекций, скорость роста SARS-CoV-2 меньше, чем у других респираторных вирусов. Это значит, что и грипп, и многие другие патогены должны его побеждать.

[  Коинфекция новым коронавирусом и: гриппом \(верхний левый угол\); респираторно-синцитиальным вирусом \(верхний правый угол\); риновирусом \(слева в центре\); парагриппом \(справа в центре\); метапневмовирусом \(внизу\). Штрихпунктриная линия — изменение титра при инфекции только одним вирусом, сплошные показывают динамику при коинфекции. Черный пунктир — граница детекции титра. Lubna Pinky Hana M. Dobrovolny \/ Journal of Medical Virology, 2020](https://preview.redd.it/2xxg7kqxngq61.jpg?width=1333&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e68623d7ce9ab1165d10064f122983672984da5e)

У коронавируса появляется шанс на совместное заражение, только если он попадет в клетку за 5 дней до вируса гриппа. А вытеснить конкурента он сможет, только если другой вирус попытается вторгнуться в организм спустя 10 дней с момента заражения коронавирусом.

Интересно, что даже когда доза вирусных частиц SARS-CoV-2 была в 106 раз больше количества вирусных частиц конкурента, при одновременном заражении это не помогло коронавирусу одержать убедительную победу над большинством вирусных конкурентов. Хотя коронавирусная нагрузка может оставаться высокой еще довольно долго, при совместном заражении в таких условиях SARS-CoV-2 практически не размножается.

[ Моделирование ситуаций, в которых «стартовая доза» SARS-CoV-2 была в 100 раз больше \(сплошная линия\), в 10 000 больше \(пунктир\), 1000000 \(штрихпунктир\), чем число вирусных частиц его конкурента. IAV — грипп, RSV — респираторно-синцитиальный вирус, HRV — риновирус, PIV — парагрипп, HMPV — метапневмовирус. Lubna Pinky Hana M.

 *Судя по* [*некоторым данным*](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.20189647v2)*, редкий случай «сожительства» коронавируса и гриппа может дорого обойтись пациенту. У человека, в организме которого поселяются оба вируса, риск умереть возрастает в шесть раз, и в два раза — по сравнению с теми, кто заразился только коронавирусной инфекцией.*  

Итак — в масштабе отдельно взятого организма грипп, в теории, имеет преимущество перед коронавирусом. Куда же тогда подевался сезон гриппа?

## Честной войны не бывает

Для оценки заразности болезни эпидемиологи используют метрику R0 — это среднее количество непривитых людей без иммунитета, которые могут подхватить болезнь от одного больного человека. Если R0>1, каждый больной заражает более одного человека. Когда R0=1, эпидемия достигает пика, а когда R0<1 — идет на спад. 

У сезонных инфекций R0 сильно зависит от поведения людей. Когда на улице становится холодно, туристы и дачники возвращаются из отпусков на работу, а дети — в школу. То есть люди собираются в тесных помещениях, где так легко обмениваться вирусами. Именно поэтому простудой и гриппом мы чаще всего болеем зимой. Поэтому один из наиболее эффективных способов остановить эпидемию (помимо вакцинации) — изолировать людей друг от друга.

Коронавирусная инфекция, грипп и ОРВИ передаются от человека к человеку при чихании и кашле, поэтому лучше всего распространяются при тесном контакте. R0 у гриппа и ОРВИ одинаков — в пределах [1,4-1,6](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-7-30), а у коронавирусной болезни, по разным [оценкам](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1891) — в среднем 2,63 (от 0,4 до 4,6). Это выше, чем у сезонных инфекций. Логично, что меры, направленные на предотвращение передачи коронавирусной болезни — запреты на международные авиаперелеты, локдаун, маски и социальное дистанцирование — заодно [предотвратили](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30547) и передачу сезонных инфекций.

В этом конфликте есть еще один участник — популяционный иммунитет. Вирусы гриппа и многие вирусы ОРВИ — наши старые враги, от которых иммунные системы большинства людей учились защищаться всю жизнь. А коронавирус — «молодая» инфекция, иммунитет от которой только недавно стал появляться у привитых и переболевших. Поэтому у коронавируса все еще есть преимущество, которое гриппу просто недоступно.

## Российский грипп

В России сезон гриппа наступает в октябре и длится до конца мая. 29 марта 2020 года в стране начался «отпускной режим», на следующий день были полностью закрыты границы. Режим «всероссийской самоизоляции» продлился шесть недель, дальше решение о снятии или продлении ограничений принимали уже федеральные власти.

Данные о заболеваемости гриппом в России собирает и публикует Институт гриппа имени Смородинцева, при этом проводя выборочную диагностику вируса методом ПЦР в разных городах страны.

По данным института, с октября по декабрь 2019 года эпидемический сезон проходил довольно типично — заболеваемость была на несколько процентов ниже базовой линии в 72,2 человека на 10 000 населения. На 29 марта, то есть на 13 неделю, когда ввели всеобщий режим самоизоляции, заболеваемость превышала базовую линию на 1,9 процентов.

Уже на следующую, 14 неделю 2020 года заболеваемость упала ниже базовой — сразу на 17,9 процентов. К концу 19 недели, первой недели мая, заболеваемость была рекордно низкой — всего 20,2 человека на 10 000 населения, это ниже базовой линии на 72 процента. Это вполне разумно списать на эффект коронавирусных ограничений.

Тем более что с их отменой, хотя это и произошло на самом излете сезона гриппа, заболеваемость стала понемногу расти — на 20 неделю составила 20,8 человек на 10 тысяч, на 21 неделю — 21,2 человека, а к концу мая 21,3 человека. Июнь, июль и август в России — уже не сезон гриппа, поэтому мониторинга не велось.

[ Заболеваемость гриппом в России в 2019, 2020 и 2021 годах. Падение на «стыке» годов имеет сугубо социальную природу: в праздники люди реже обращаются за медицинской помощью при симптомах простуды.  Источник: influenza.spb.ru](https://preview.redd.it/2ysq83qoogq61.jpg?width=1371&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f1ee0e48c150262674e1c3ec5b4cc58127a13ed)

Он возобновился с 37 недели, то есть с середины сентября. В это время заболеваемость была ниже базовой линии на 25,5 процентов и составляла 53,9 человек на 10 000 населения. С 38 недели она стала понемногу расти, и к 41 неделе, то есть к середине октября, практически достигла базового уровня — 70,1 человек на 10 000 населения. Иными словами, сезон простуд начался по расписанию.

Массовой самоизоляции зимой 2020-2021 года в России уже не было. Тем не менее, на 10 неделю 2021 года заболеваемость гриппом и ОРВИ остается сравнительно невысокой — 60,9 человек на 10 000 населения, что на 13 процентов ниже базовой линии. При этом в отношении гриппа ситуация во всем подобна тому, что происходило в Австралии и ЮАР летом 2020-го: если сравнивать [отчеты](https://www.influenza.spb.ru/system/epidemic_situation/laboratory_diagnostics/) о лабораторной диагностике гриппа за 2021 и 2020 год, то  больше всего положительных ПЦР-тестов на вирус гриппа в 2021 году было зарегистрировано на 9-й неделе — их целых 7 на 3320 проб, в то время как год назад в ту же самую неделю «гриппозными» были 1612 проб из 4826. Поэтому если о «сезоне простуд» в России еще можно говорить, то вот сезона гриппа, судя по всему, не случилось.

## Они возвращаются

Сезонный пик заболеваемости в Австралии приходится приблизительно на середину июля, а сам сезон простуд длится с января по август. В 2020 году это время пришлось на активные противоэпидемические мероприятия — уже 20 марта австралийские границы были закрыты, а локдаун длился с 29 марта по 27 апреля. 29 апреля дети вернулись в школу, но правила социального дистанцирования и масочный режим там соблюдают до сих пор.

В первые 13 недель 2020 года, до введения ограничений, число выявленных случаев простуды и гриппа было таким же, как и в предыдущие сезоны: 29 случаев простуды и 24 случая гриппа в день. А следующие 21 недель волна сезонных болезней, вместо того чтобы нарастать, куда-то пропала: [было выявлено](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1475/5912591) 10 случаев RSV и 1 случай гриппа. По сравнению со средними показателями до пандемии, количество выявленных ОРВИ упало на 98 процента, а гриппа — на 99,4 процента.  

Но после того, как локдаун ослабили, дети вернулись в школу, а австралийский сезон простуд должен был закончиться, число случаев простуды резко [пошло вверх](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1906/6140790) (о гриппе данных пока нет). В конце декабря, то есть в «простудное межсезонье» для Австралии, число случаев в 2,6 раза превысило сезонный пик заболеваемости, который в норме приходится на июнь.

Но почему пик оказался таким высоким? Возможно, дело именно в «пропущенном» сезоне простуд. Поскольку сидевшие в карантине люди не встречались ни с какими респираторными вирусами, адаптивный иммунный ответ, который защищает хозяина [независимо от наличия антител](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009273) к конкретному штамму, не тренировался бороться с простудными вирусами.

[ Кривые заболеваемости простудой в Австралии. Черная линия — базовый уровень заболеваемости \(2012-2019 годы\), красная — динамика начиная с сентября 2020 года. После снятия ограничений заболеваемость резко пошла вверх\/ Daniel K Yeoh et al. \/ Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2020](https://preview.redd.it/iov490j9pgq61.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd037fd1e00f8e942f64c4643bc9784ea97621d9)

 В результате, когда люди вышли с карантина, восприимчивых к простудным вирусам среди них оказалось больше. Подобная ситуация характерна не только для Австралии. После снятия ограничений та же самая картина наблюдалась, например, [в Гонконге](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/5/21-0277_article).

О том, каким будет простудный сезон в этом году, судить пока тяжело. Скорее всего, в Северном полушарии, как и в Южном, сезон простуд сдвинется на несколько месяцев. А еще [некоторые эксперты считают](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3), что часть привычных нам гриппозных штаммов может исчезнуть. Но радоваться рано: «массовое вымирание» некоторых вирусных штаммов может открыть дорогу новым, более суровым возбудителям. А если учесть, что за время локдаунов человечество порядком растеряло свой противовирусный иммунитет, есть вероятность, что грядущий сезон простуд будет еще тяжелее предыдущих.

انتشار فيروس في الصين ومخاوف من تحوله إلى جائحة عالمية ,2025-01-06 19:04:59,82,https://i.redd.it/l972h8k9mdbe1.jpeg,"تشهد الصين ارتفاعا في حالات الإصابة بفيروس تنفسي، مما أدى إلى تقارير عن اكتظاظ المستشفيات، وتدابير مراقبة جديدة ومخاوف عامة بشأن تفشي المرض.
وقد شهد الفيروس، الذي تم تحديده باسم الفيروس الرئوي البشري HMPV)، ارتفاعا حادا في الحالات في جميع أنحاء المقاطعات الشمالية الصينية هذا الشتاء، وخاصة بين الأطفال.
يأتي تفشي المرض بعد 5 سنوات من تنبيه العالم لأول مرة إلى ظهور فيروس كورونا الجديد في ووهان بالصين، والذي تحول لاحقا إلى جائحة عالمية مع الإبلاغ عن 7 ملايين حالة وفاة.
ايش الإجراءات المتبعه في حال وصوله للخليج؟
نفس الإجراءات المتبعة لمكافحة فيروس كورونا.

"China, hMPV, and the `Fog of Flu'",2025-01-05 19:23:47,6,https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/01/china-hmpv-and-fog-of-flu.html?m=1,"China has a well-deserved reputation for treating `bad news' as a national security issue. Anything that might cause economic harm, societal distress, or put the CCP in a bad light is either `sanitized' or suppressed by the government run media. 

The 2002 SARS outbreak was hidden from the world for months (see SARS and Remembrance), until it turned up in Hong Kong in 2003. 

China often only belated reports avian flu outbreaks (see The Winter Of Our Disbelief  and  The Skies Aren't The Only Thing Hazy In China)

China was slow to release details on the 2020 COVID outbreak and appears to have covered up millions of COVID deaths (see JAMA Open: Excess All-Cause Mortality in China After Ending the Zero COVID Policy).

And just over a year ago China was less-than-forthcoming about an outbreak of severe pneumonia (see Taiwan MOH Statement On Respiratory Outbreak In Mainland China).

China obviously isn't alone in `managing' bad news (see The Wrong Pandemic Lessons Learned). 

Their success in these matters has shown the world there is little downside to selective reporting (see From Here to Impunity).

What we are left with is a `fog of flu', where internet rumor and speculation rushes in to fill the vacuum left by official silence.  

As I mentioned yesterday, there are numerous unconfirmed reports of a `mystery' viral outbreak in China.  Typical reports suggest overcrowded hospitals, and even increased crematory activity. 

Unofficially, hMPV (Human Metapneumovirus) - which was only first isolated in 2001 - has been cited by the media as a likely cause (see Newsweek's HMPV: China's Neighbors Respond Amid Virus Outbreak).

China's most recent weekly influenza report (week 52) - published on Jan 2nd -  doesn't specifically mention hMPV, but does provide the following graphic which shows an H1N1 dominant flu season, albeit with a fairly high number of non-influenza positive cases (particularly in Northern Provinces). 

Most winters, Influenza A viruses only cause about 15% of acute viral infections. The rest come from a variable hodgepodge of other viruses, including RSV, Influenza B, Adenoviruses, Rhinoviruses, HCoVs, and Human Metapneumoviruses. 

Last January's ISIRV: Comparative Mortality in Patients Hospitalized With influenza A/B virus, RSV, Rhinovirus, Metapneumovirus or SARS-CoV-2, found (unsurprisingly) that COVID was still deadlier than influenza A. 

The surprise came in finding that - among those sick enough to be hospitalized - Influenza A&B, RSV, Rhinovirus, and hMPV all had roughly the same 30 day mortality rate.

3.3 Crude 30-day mortality

Crude mortality at 30 days following admission accumulated to 18% for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 9% for influenza A, 11% for influenza B, 10% for RSV, 8% for rhinovirus and 9% for hMPV infections (Table 1, Figure 2). Crude SARS-CoV-2 mortality was higher than for all other viruses, though a progressive decline in mortality over the course of the pandemic was found (March–Aug 2020: 25%, Sept 2020–Feb 2021: 21%, March–Aug 2021: 14%, Sept 2021–Feb 2022: 14%). Crude mortality for all non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses was comparable (Table 1, Figure 2).

3.4 Covariate-adjusted 30-day mortality

Following adjustment for covariates, 30-day mortality odds ratio (OR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of pandemic phase, was 2.70 (95% CI: 1.98–3.77) versus influenza A. No differences were found in adjusted ORs for 30-day mortality of influenza B, RSV, rhinovirus and hMPV infections (aOR influenza B: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.67–1.64), aOR RSV: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.63–1.71), aOR hMPV: 0.93 (0.54–1.55) and aOR rhinovirus: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.65–1.52, influenza A as reference, Table 2). In this cohort, age was related to mortality following hospitalisation, while an association with comorbidity was not apparent.

What isn't well established is how likely each of these viral infections is to put someone in the hospital.  
A 2019 study, however (see “Differential risk of hospitalization among single virus infections causing influenza‐like illnesses” suggests - based on limited data - that children with RSV or hMPV are more likely to be hospitalized than with influenza A or B and other common viral infections. 

While hMPV is a plausible cause of the rumored outbreak in China, this doesn't get us any closer to knowing what is actually happening there. The CCP exercises strict control over the media, and much of what we do hear comes from the dissident press, which have their own agenda.

While we wait for more news, over the next few weeks hundreds of millions of people in China (and all across Asia) will travel home for the Lunar New Year (Jan 29th), which constitutes the largest annual human migration on earth.

Chunyun - or the Spring Festival travel season - begins about 15 days before the Lunar New Year and runs for about 40 days total. 

If there is truly something unusual spreading in Northern China - and that has yet to be established - then we might start seeing reports from other provinces, and from neighboring countries, that will help clarify matters. 

Regardless of what happens with China, the next global public health crisis is not only inevitable, it may be a lot closer than we think.

I didn't realize that SARS2 was killing 1 in 4 at its beginning down to 1 in 7 by Feb '22.

And SARS2 (aka Covid-19) was killing roughly 18 per 100k - yes, still much more deadly than Flu A/B. These days verifying the numbers is even more difficult.\n\nAt such low numbers, hMPV does not sound like the current culprit in China, as the current mortality rate is about 1 in 3 (from what has been reported).

# Cúm A lan mạnh ở Thượng Hải; bệnh viện Sơn Đông, Bắc Kinh hơn 1000 lượt khám/ngày

Chủ Nhật, 12/01/2025

**Sự bùng phát dịch cúm A gần đây ở Trung Quốc đã gây ra tình trạng quá tải tại các bệnh viện và tâm lý hoang mang trong xã hội Tàu Cộng**. 

Số ca chờ khám được xác nhận tại một số bệnh viện ở Bắc Kinh và Sơn Đông lên tới 1.000 ca mỗi ngày, ***số ca nhiễm được xác nhận tại một bệnh viện ở Thượng Hải chỉ trong 1 tuần của tháng 1 đã gần bằng tổng số ca của tháng 12 năm ngoái.*** 

Không ít cư dân mạng Trung Quốc Đại Lục nói thẳng rằng đó chính là virus Corona mới (COVID-19). Mặc dù **cư dân mạng ở Thượng Hải, Bắc Kinh và những nơi khác ở Trung Quốc đã tiết lộ các trường hợp tử vong trên mạng xã hội, nhưng cho đến nay vẫn chưa có thông báo chính thức nào.**

https://preview.redd.it/gvnkkqyt2jce1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e0be0c513d2c850fe948a702f52b1241c7f63ee

Virus cúm đang hoành hành khắp Trung Quốc Đại Lục, nhiều bệnh viện nhi đang quá tải. Một số trẻ thậm chí đã tử vong vì làn sóng virus này. Trên nền tảng Douyin ở Đại lục, một cư dân mạng ở Thượng Hải cho biết anh đã tận mắt chứng kiến một trẻ em chết do cúm A và cho biết: “Làn sóng cúm A này đã giết chết nhiều trẻ em”. Sơn Đông và những nơi khác đã báo cáo các trường hợp tử vong tại địa phương do cúm A, gồm cả người lớn và trẻ em. Tuy nhiên, **giới chức Đảng Cộng sản Trung Quốc (ĐCSTQ) vẫn chưa chính thức công bố các ca bệnh nặng hoặc tử vong, và thế giới bên ngoài thường nghi ngờ rằng ĐCSTQ lại che giấu dịch bệnh để tôn vinh sự lãnh đạo thần kỳ của kỳ tài tên Bình giống vụ cúm Tàu 2020-2021.**

Tài khoản “Cô gái nông thôn” ở Hồ Nam với 3,84 triệu người hâm mộ, đăng một video hôm 9/1 nói rằng cô và chồng mới trở về Hồ Nam từ Thâm Quyến, chồng cô bị nhiễm cúm A ở Thâm Quyến và tình trạng sức khỏe không tốt, phải uống thuốc và tiêm thuốc liên tục. Khi trở về quê hương ở Hồ Nam, tình trạng của chồng cô trở nên tồi tệ hơn. Ngày 8/1, đến bệnh viện khám và phát hiện bị viêm phổi, sốt cao 40 độ C, phải nhập viện và điều trị bằng truyền dịch.

Cô đến thăm chồng trong bệnh viện, chồng cô cho biết anh cảm thấy rất khó chịu, không còn sức lực, hoa mắt. Anh nói: “Tưởng rằng hôm qua (8/1) tiêm xong thì sẽ tốt hơn một chút, nhưng không ngờ càng khó chịu hơn. Cảm giác bản thân mình như đã đến tận cùng của sinh mệnh”.

Cô kể chồng cô bị sốt dẫn đến tai đỏ bừng, bệnh viện chật kín bệnh nhân, các phòng bệnh quá đông, chồng cô nằm ở hành lang bệnh viện, hơn nữa hành lang cũng đầy bệnh nhân.

Một số cư dân mạng đã bình luận về video của cô.

Cư dân mạng Quảng Đông nói rằng: Trong khoảng thời gian này, có quá nhiều người bị nôn mửa và tiêu chảy.

Cư dân mạng Hồ Bắc: Sự lây nhiễm đã lan rộng trên toàn quốc và nhiều người xung quanh tôi cũng bị nhiễm bệnh.

Cư dân mạng Chiết Giang: Các triệu chứng nhiễm trùng do cúm A gây ra khó chịu hơn so với loại virus Corona mới, và các bệnh viện thì xuất hiện biển người.

Blogger Sơn Đông “Dishi” đã đăng một video hôm 9/1 nói rằng virus này hiện đang hoành hành, và dịch cúm A trên toàn quốc đang rất nghiêm trọng. Trợ lý của ông bị sốt hôm 8/1 và được chẩn đoán mắc bệnh cúm A vào ngày 9/1. Ông hy vọng mọi người sẽ tự bảo vệ mình.

Blogger An Huy “Mitang” hôm 9/1 cho biết dịch cúm A đang tấn công rất mạnh, 4 người trong một gia đình 5 người đã bị nhiễm bệnh. Họ bị sốt cao, ho và đau họng, quá khó chịu.

I think I’ve seen this film before. This and bird flu’s series.', '\nMedical News: Surge in Cases Raises Concerns\nChina has been grappling with a marked increase in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections and related hospitalizations since mid-December 2024.\n\nReports from various provinces indicate a steady rise in cases, creating apprehension about the possibility of a novel viral outbreak. However, health officials have emphasized that HMPV is not a new virus but a relatively under-recognized respiratory pathogen.\n\n\xa0 Experts have pointed out that HMPV is often overshadowed by more widely known respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). This Medical News report aims to provide a detailed and accessible explanation of the situation, delving into the latest developments and their implications.\n\n\xa0 Spotlight on New HMPV Lineages\nResearchers in China have recently identified new lineages of HMPV belonging to subtype A2. These lineages reportedly exhibit significant mutations in three key proteins, raising questions about their potential impact on disease severity and transmission.\n\nWhile detailed data has not yet been made public, early findings have prompted a closer investigation. Some scientists have speculated that these mutations could make the virus more neurotrophic, meaning it may have a higher likelihood of affecting the nervous system.\n\n\xa0 Also, many local media reports are mentioning about infected individuals feeling a sense of dizziness and also cognitive issues, and also cases of children and the elderly being admitted due to encephalitis are all \xa0indirectly validating that the new HMPV lineages could be more neurotrophic after all.\n\n\xa0 Domestic media outlets have noted that many individuals with HMPV infections are experiencing flu-like symptoms, such as dizziness, persistent cough, and fatigue. However, experts caution that these symptoms are non-specific and overlap significantly with those of other respiratory illnesses.\n\n\xa0 A Familiar but Often Overlooked Threat\nHMPV is not a new pathogen. Discovered in 2001, it has been circulating globally for over six decades, causing infections across all age groups. According to Zheng Lishu, a virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus typically causes mild symptoms that resolve within a week. However, i t can lead to severe complications in vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.\n\n\xa0 Ruan Zhengshang, an infectious disease expert at Xinhua Hospital in Shanghai, has advised the public not to self-diagnose based on symptoms alone. “It is not accurate to differentiate between influenza, HMPV, and other respiratory infections based on the severity of fever or dizziness,” he explained. Instead, he urged individuals with worsening symptoms to seek professional medical evaluation.\n\n\xa0 Challenges in Diagnosis\nUnlike influenza or COVID-19, HMPV does not yet have widely available rapid diagnostic tests. Laboratory testing, while accurate, is both expensive and time-consuming, posing a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, many cases may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed as other respiratory illnesses.\n\n\xa0 Managing and Preventing Infections\nTang Lanfang, a pediatric respiratory specialist from Children’s Hospital at Zhejiang University, has highlighted the need for vigilance among parents and caregivers. Severe cases of HMPV can lead to pneumonia, especially in children. Symptoms such as persistent high fever, worsening cough, lethargy, and shortness of breath should prompt immediate medical attention.\n\n\xa0 Currently, there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for HMPV. Management focuses on supportive care, including adequate rest, hydration, and symptom relief. Preventive measures are crucial and include wearing masks, frequent hand washing, ensuring proper ventilation, and avoiding crowded spaces - guidelines echoed by both Chinese and international health authorities.\n\n\xa0 Concluding Thoughts\nThe ongoing rise in HMPV infections in China underscores the need for heightened awareness and continued research. The emergence of new lineages within subtype A2 raises important questions about the virus’s behavior and its potential implications for public health. While most cases remain mild, the risk to vulnerable groups highlights the importance of prevention and timely medical intervention.\n\nSource - Thailand Medical News\n\nhttps://www.thailand medical.news\n\n/news/hmpv-infections-and-hospitalizations-continue-to-rise-in-china-while-researchers-are-focusing-on-the-new-lineages-from-subtype-a2?fbclid=IwY2xjawHpIVpleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHQ5nnANOoIIjllpUm_-ZlwehufsHOzRkFrEVj1vYP71ep0DLgcNwEZwVEQ_aem_d2FKdl4L5giUDtC_Ha4OdQ\n\nRemove the spaces.', 'it is here in the states and rolling through like wildfire', ""I am here because I do believe another pandemic could be imminent.

In many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, trends in acute respiratory infections increase at this time of year. These increases are typically caused by seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other common respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae. Many countries conduct routine surveillance for acute respiratory infections and common respiratory pathogens. Currently, in some countries in the temperate Northern hemisphere, influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) rates have increased in recent weeks and are above baseline levels, following usual seasonal trends. Seasonal influenza activity is elevated in many countries in the Northern hemisphere. Where surveillance data is available, trends in RSV detections currently vary by region with decreases reported in most regions except in North America. Recently, there has been interest in hMPV cases in China including suggestions of hospitals being overwhelmed. hMPV is a common respiratory virus found to circulate in many countries in winter through to spring, although not all countries routinely test and publish data on trends in hMPV . While some cases can be hospitalized with bronchitis or pneumonia, most people infected with hMPV have mild upper respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold and recover after a few days. Based on data published by China, covering the period up to 29 December 2024, acute respiratory infections have increased during recent weeks and detections of seasonal influenza, rhinovirus, RSV, and hMPV, particularly in northern provinces of China have also increased. The observed increase in respiratory pathogen detections is within the range expected for this time of year during the Northern hemisphere winter. In China, influenza is the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen currently affecting people with acute respiratory infections. WHO is in contact with Chinese health officials and has not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns. Chinese authorities report that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses triggered. WHO continues to monitor respiratory illnesses at global, regional and country levels through collaborative surveillance systems, and provides updates as needed.

Description of the Situation 

In many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, trends in acute respiratory infections increase at this time of year. These increases are typically caused by seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza, RSV, and other common respiratory viruses, including hMPV, as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens during the winter season can sometimes cause an increased burden on health care systems treating sick persons.

Currently, in some countries in the temperate Northern hemisphere, influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) rates have increased in recent weeks and are above baseline levels, following usual seasonal trends. Influenza activity is elevated in many countries in Europe, Central America and the Caribbean, Western Africa, Middle Africa, and many countries across Asia, with the predominant seasonal influenza type and subtype varying by location, typical for this time of year, except during most of 2020 and 2021, when there was little influenza activity during the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2 activity as detected in sentinel surveillance and reported to Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), along with wastewater monitoring from the reporting countries, is currently low in countries in the Northern hemisphere following prolonged high level activity during summer months in the Northern hemisphere. Where surveillance data is available, trends in RSV activity are variable by region with downward trends observed in most subregions of the Americas, except in North America where RSV activity has increased, and decreases have been observed in the European region in recent weeks. Some countries conduct routine surveillance and report trends for other commonly circulating respiratory pathogens, such as hMPV, and report such information on a routine basis. Some countries in the Northern hemisphere have reported increased trends, varying by virus, in recent weeks, typical for this time of year.

Not once can they name a single specific toxin/chemical/poison/negative emotion/etc that has been shown to cause the flu, Ebola, rabies, plague, tuberculosis, etc.  In fact no one even gives advice on how to *avoid* them. The only thing said is to let your body kill itself as it ""detoxifies"" itself of these unknown nebulous toxins.  Why suffer if you can easily avoid the toxin or whatever that\'s responsible for causing your ailments. And this doesn\'t even begin to scratch the surface that is the abysmal failure of terrain theory to explain why common causes don\'t cause rare events at a more common occurrence. As an example I\'ve seen rabies be blamed on malnutrition/famine (after much poking and questioning done). Over a billion people across the planet are malnourished and rabies only has ~56,000 cases per year with the majority focused in India.

No. \n\nCan I avoid cold dreary weather (without moving country)? No. \n\nPersonally I would question whether a known chemical/element causes symptoms similar to a particular disease. For example Polio and heavy metal poisoning (look at spinal lesions if you are actually interested). Small pox and serious malnutrition coupled with severe bedbug infestation (and subsequent bug fecal matter composition). The most recent ebola incident that I am aware of was said to be due to a tainted malaria vaccine which affected aid workers. (special mention of tainted vaccines goes to Bill Gates and his Polio vaccine in India). Other than that the ebola virus only seems to be present in African countries where I am sure they don't have the best safety standards for chemical fertilisers and the like. \n\nMy personal belief is that both flu and colds are not viruses but are just a general bodily warning system. Each person has their own personal threshold for the amount of nasties their body can easily vanquish (based on age, fitness, diet etc). If the body becomes slightly overwhelmed (or doesn't understand why its temperature has fluctuated so much in a short space of time - see current UK weather change over the past week or two) it brings about the symptoms associated with having a cold to force you to take it easy and not increase the strain. If further nasties are added (or a greater hit of nasties in one go) the body tries to limit activity and promote rest which results in flu symptoms. If you want to test this theory I would suggest that you ingest large amounts of nasties in the form of alcohol. You will notice that the majority of hangover symptoms are the exact same as flu symptoms. Albeit with vomiting replacing nasal discharge due to the method of consumption of said nasties. \n\nAs for your rabies bit, personally I would look up what else causes light/water aversion and foaming at the mouth, taking a look at the composition of the saliva of canines in particular as this seems to be the source of transmission. So, it would be something that is present in the dog and being released into the saliva. \n\nSadly I don't have the funding to investigate these kind of things personally."", ""So you are telling me that to replicate something that supposedly happens in passing strangers (and millions of times each year) you must take a swab directly from someone's nose, cultivate that, add stabilizers, buffers, salt etc etc then directly squirt that (at sufficient dose) into someone's nose? \n\nWow, that totally proves viral transmission! And it is in no way different from real world conditions which produces countless cases. \n\nYou really think that this far removed from reality set of conditions producing some nonsense result that cant be proven without modern technology constitutes proof of viral transmission? It only proves that you can force somebody to absorb RNA through the nose (when the dose is high enough etc etc). Obviously this is just means that you can administer covid shots (and any other terrible self replicating sequence) without needing to actually inject someone. A terrifying prospect.""]"

I would like to start with the money, this company will never go bankrupt. It's margins are super fat, and will get even fatter this year.

I noticed the **available shares to short** went from **7.8 million shares** last week to **4.8 million shares** today when I checked. **15 million shares** are the absolute total available to short, I believe. That would explain the price action. I thought the shorts would be exiting as we head for earnings but they are not, hopefully the squeeze launches us back to the moon.

**Margins**

* **Net profit margins of 67%**
   * Compared to Pfizer of 33%
   * JNJ between 7% to 27%, depending on the quarter
   * Merck 13% to 34%
* Takes between $500,000 to $1 million to take a drug from discovery to start of clinical phases
   * Compared to **$1 Billion** for every other pharmaceutical company
   * This is why it is easy for them to develop vaccines to variants
* The price of the original vaccine dose was 100ug for $25 (4ug/$1). 
   * The booster dose is 50ug for $25 (2ug/$1). 
   * **Profit margin of over 80% later this year**

* All researchers go though a accelerated learning program that teaches them how to use the Moderna Platform.
* The system basically looks like shopping on Amazon.
* It takes a few clicks to design a mRNA drug and the completed doses will be delivered (2-3 days)
* The platform shows you which components would give you the most desired outcome.

   * Cancer cells can camouflage themselves, injecting this medicine makes them expose themselves for the dirty cancer that they are. Then your immune system can study it and go find any other cancer cells hiding in your body.
   * Started June 2019, and official completion in 2025
      * Moderna expects to post results in 4th quarter of 2022
   * Most people know there is no good treatment for Lung or Pancreatic Cancer
   * Pancreatic cancer treatment can cost north of $200,000. The American Cancer Society estimates it at $8,000 a month
* mRNA-1644 & mRNA-1644-V2: HIV vaccines
   * Started 2021

**Preclinical**

* **mRNA-1273.529 - Omicron variant**
* mRNA-1020
* mRNA-1030
* mRNA-3351: Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 1 (CN-1)
   * They are providing the medicine for free, but another organization is going to perform the clinical trial.
   * Toxic build-up of Unconjugated Bilirubin leads to deposition in brain and eventually death
   * This therapeutic would help metabolize it to it's non-toxic form
   * There are other not as toxic versions of this disease that people would also benefit, as well as people with liver issue

**Terms:**

* Phase 1, 2, & 3 aim to answer different questions. Since Moderna mainly test the same dose ranges they are able to combine their clinical trials. That's why you'll see combined Phase 1/2 or Phase 2/3. It also shortens the clinical pipeline
* Phase 1: Studies the Pharmacokinetics
   * *""What the body does to the drug""*
   * absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
* Phase 2: Studies Pharmacodynamics
   * ""What the drugs do to the body""
   * Drug-receptor (or enzyme) interaction in target tissue
   * Association of dosage on therapeutic effect and side effect
      * At what level do you get the balance of most good for least bad
* Phase 3: Clinical efficacy and Safety
   * Does this drug work and is it safe
* FDA-Fast Track
   * Accelerated Approval and Priority Review
   * Allows more frequent meetings with FDA, as well as more frequent written communication
   * Rolling Review
      * Submit sections as they are completed, rather than waiting to submit everything at once
* Orphan Drugs
   * Less than 200,000 people in the US suffer from the disease
   * Such rare diseases that the main goal is to recoup cost of production
   * Typically they can charge past $40k or $50k per dose.
   * Interesting enough, Moderna's margins may actually allow them to make profit off these super rare drug treatments
      * Math 200,000 people x $10,000 per dose x 12 doses per year = would be $24 billion per year.
      * Even if it were $1,000 per dose it would still be $2.4 billion off something no other pharmaceutical company wants to treat
      * Crazy part is it would actually be saving Americans a lot of money every year

There are TWO Flu A strains going around in addition to Flu B — Stay vigilant!,2025-02-07 00:27:36,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/flu/comments/1ija9ak/there_are_two_flu_a_strains_going_around_in/,"My purpose for this is to remind everyone that there are TWO Flu A strains circulating.. H1N1 (the swine flu which caused a pandemic in 2009) and the H3N2 strain — they are almost an even 50/50 split for all recorded Flu A cases. Flu B is only accounting for about 5% of recorded cases, but it is out there. 

This means that even though you tested positive for Flu A, you absolutely can get reinfected by another strain (in addition to COVID, RSV and HMPV). You are not “in the clear” for the rest of the season, so please stay vigilant with your hygiene/while out in the public. 

I’ve seen some people post saying they got sick, got better and then 3-4 weeks later “it came back,” when actually, they’ve unfortunately just picked up a different strain. 

You are contagious with the Flu for **seven** days after your last symptom appears. Some people are saying “you’re good after 24 hrs of no fever” when that is factually incorrect. Some people don’t get a fever with the Flu, so again this logic in general is flawed. Please feel free to check the CDC website for confirmation. If you are going out before the seven days, you are actively spreading the illness so please be mindful when interacting with small children and the elderly and mask up! 

Stay safe out there. I sincerely hope everyone starts feeling better ASAP. This season has been ROUGH.

"China: Many patients have tested positive for H1N1. Increase in infections due to multiple pathogens, including hMPV, RSV, COVID-19, etc. ",2025-01-02 13:49:55,1,https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1820032514928149071&wfr=spider&for=pc,"
Zhejiang Online, December 31 (Reporter Sun Jingyi) - Recently, the number of patients with respiratory infections visiting the respiratory outpatient clinics of major hospitals has increased sharply. Not long ago, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention released the recent monitoring of respiratory infectious diseases across the country, and the data showed that acute respiratory infectious diseases showed a continuous upward trend.

　　On December 31, the reporter went to the Respiratory Department and Fever Clinic of Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital and saw that the waiting area was full of patients waiting for treatment. Many of them were wearing masks, and coughing and light conversations could be heard occasionally. At around 10 a.m., the number calling system of the Respiratory Department showed that the number had been received by patient No. 81, while the number called by the Fever Clinic had been up to No. 30.

　　Sun Yilan, chief physician and director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, told reporters that the number of patients seen by the department has increased significantly in the past week, and **most of them were diagnosed with influenza A** virus infection. ""The influenza A test we did in the past week had a 30% positive rate, and three out of ten patients were infected with influenza A.""

　　Xiao Wu is one of the people infected with influenza A. Not long ago, he went to see a doctor because of discomfort and was eventually diagnosed with influenza A. ""At first I just felt a little tired and my throat was a little dry, but I didn't expect my temperature to rise the next day, my throat was sore, and I had a cough,"" said Xiao Wu.

　　Xiao Wu's symptoms are typical of flu. Sun Yilan said that the main symptoms of respiratory infectious diseases are fever, body aches, fatigue, and may also be accompanied by sore throat, nasal congestion, sneezing, dry throat, coughing, etc. Some patients with more serious conditions may also experience breathing difficulties, chest tightness, and persistent high fever.

　　""For patients who have developed symptoms but have not sought medical treatment, they can treat the symptoms themselves, such as using antipyretics or physical cooling to deal with fever, and using cough suppressants to relieve cough. Most influenza diseases can recover on their own within a week. However, for patients at high risk of severe influenza, such as the elderly over 60 years old, patients with chronic underlying diseases, children, pregnant women and obese people, it is recommended to go to the hospital as soon as possible for a clear diagnosis and receive antiviral treatment to prevent possible complications, including pneumonia, myocarditis, etc."" said Sun Yilan.

　　Influenza A virus is a highly contagious pathogen that spreads quickly and widely. Xiao Wu has a child under 2 years old. After the diagnosis, he immediately took measures to isolate the family. ""I am really worried that the virus will be passed on to the child. After all, children's resistance is much weaker than that of adults.""

　　The Double Festival is approaching, and the train tickets for the first day of the 2025 Spring Festival travel season are also on sale today. The increase in the flow of people has undoubtedly provided a breeding ground for the rapid spread of the virus. How to prevent it? Sun Yilan gave some suggestions - wash your hands frequently, wear masks in crowded places, open windows and ventilate indoor environments regularly, keep the air flowing, eat a balanced diet, rest regularly, and improve immunity. If a family member is already sick, it is recommended to isolate them and wash your hands after touching things that the patient has touched.

**In fact, in addition to influenza virus, mycoplasma, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, etc. are also the causes of current respiratory diseases. Among them, the less popular pathogen ""human metapneumovirus"" is frequently mentioned.**

　　Sun Yilan explained that human metapneumovirus is not a new virus. It was first isolated in 2001. According to current research, it can cause the common cold, just like rhinovirus and adenovirus. The main symptoms are fever, runny nose, cough, etc., and high fever is rare. ""Currently, there is no vaccine or specific drug for human metapneumovirus. Treatment measures are mostly symptomatic supportive treatment, and prevention methods are the same as influenza.""

[...] 


Recently, many influenza patients have been tested positive for the H1N1 type, which is not the ""new strain"" circulated on the Internet. 

Recently, the proportion of patients with respiratory tract infections visiting the respiratory departments of major hospitals has increased sharply. ""There are many people with respiratory symptoms, and the relevant clinical symptoms are also different. Most of the patients have taken medication on their own before coming to the hospital, and some come to the hospital for treatment because of poor results."" Zhou Jianping, deputy chief physician of the respiratory department of Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, told reporters that in the late winter season, the temperature fluctuates, coupled with the influence of smog from time to time, and the flu virus infection, which is showing an increasing trend, respiratory tract infections are ""rather annoying.""

Wore them right to work on a half-day I spent while sick with what could have been HMPV, the comfort is reminiscent to thin Yeezy Slides. They're not breathable at all obviously since they're a closed slip-on. Material lines up with $20, though some argue it'd be worth less - unlike the Pods, the material makes these actually good for going through the rain or on wet ground. Snow testing is yet to be done.

Damage durability is iffy, I tripped up slightly on some broken pavement and it left a small chip that doesn't clear - though again, they're cheap so I can get more when more pop up.

Chiropractic adjustment - instant relief,2025-01-31 07:10:00,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1ie3khz/chiropractic_adjustment_instant_relief/,"I hope this story helps someone else, that is the reason for my posting it.

Very long story short is this...

In 2019 I was a very healthy active person.  In 2020, after a horrible experience with COVID, RSV, and HMPV all back to back, my lungs were broken.  Asthma was debilitating even with tons of meds and prednisone.  I went to every specialist to try to fix me, but nothing ever worked fully. Always short of breath and they said it was because of scaring. Then I had an endoscopy which exposed a 3mm hiatal hernia with very bad acid damage.  This was much more than just asthma.

I have been on pantoprazole for 4 months with good results, but I had a constant feeling of something stuck in my throat.  I would lose my voice often, and couldn't eat much.  Dropped 10 lbs.

This week I went to a chiropractor who said its possible to adjust HH.  He went to try and it was the most painful experience. I could tell there was something inside my chest that needed to be pushed harder.

What I did next was potentially stupid, but I was so angry and frustrated that I had to try to adjust this myself.   I took the bottom of a wooden spoon and shoved it below my sternum, took a huge breath and pushed on that pain.  There was a popping sound, and immediate release of the feeling in my throat.  All symptoms were gone... just like that.  Yes, my chest was bruised and in pain from the spoon, but this thing worked.

Went back to the chiropractor and he confirmed he didn't feel anything pushing back anymore.

It had been 4 years of daily suffering.  I was right on track for surgery, but the last 48 hours have been life changing.  I hope it lasts!!!!

Hopefully this gives someone else hope or at least another avenue to try to some relief.","[Comment(id='ma4if83'), Comment(id='ma8i78x'), Comment(id='ma5rl9u'), Comment(id='ma8zyrz'), Comment(id='mankw6d'), Comment(id='makvsb2'), Comment(id='ma4jk0s'), Comment(id='ma92ajk'), Comment(id='matwxn6'), Comment(id='makwagu'), Comment(id='ma97pop'), Comment(id='mauas80'), Comment(id='makxkqj'), Comment(id='mab10hu'), Comment(id='makxxau')]","['dude you just won the hiatal hernia fix lottery', 'I had to have 3 adjustments for my stomach to “stay” but I also experienced profound relief almost a year ago now.

"My first time with COVID-19, visiting/staying at elderly parents, nervous",2023-06-02 09:03:11,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/13y1xo7/my_first_time_with_covid19_visitingstaying_at/,"Hi all, 

This is my first time with COVID-19. I am quadruple-vaxxed (first vaccine 1-2, booster, bivalent), and was regularly masking w KN94s or KN95s, except I started to slip on the masking recently--for short errands (running in and out of a cafe \~10 min) or family events. I'm a 30sF.

I traveled via plane on Sunday cross-country, wore an Aura N95, and did lift up to take a few sips of water, and eat chips for brief moments during flight/cruising. I then went to a family member's house that night where there were intergenerational aunts, uncles, cousins, and their toddlers. I overheard someone share that an elderly member in one of the cousin's extended families had Covid, but assumed/hoped they did not see that family member recently, unmasked. The next day, Monday, I did mask at a grocery store , but then was unmasked a coffee shop/pastry shop for 10 minutes  (I succumbed to feeling foolish being the only masked person at the grocery store tbh, and have recently not always masked for the seemingly-short errands--my bad).

Anyways, I tested positive today, and I've been isolating in my childhood room at my parent's place ever since. My parents and sibling are staying away, masking, and we are opening windows as much as we can. I'd love any well-wishes, advice. I'm mad but mostly mad at myself. We also found out that one of the cousins had stuffy nose and a fever on Monday and their kid followed suit on Tuesday--neither tested--while my elderly uncle has a fever and gastrointestinal issues today, pending an update on any testing if they do it.

Here's where things are at: 

\- Exposure: who knows? masked in plane? or unmasked at family gathering, pastry errand?

\- Tuesday, Day 0: feels like allergies, which always happens a few days within visiting my parents home and/or being with my sibling's dog. Usually a Claritin etc clears it up, so I take an anti-histamine and its great but I realize I kinda have a headache.

\- Wednesday, Day 1: okay this has got to be something else and not just allergies; symptoms: dry throat, head/nasal congestion,  occasional cough, some chills, headache; Covid test (mouth and nose swab) = negative; took Sudafed but then switched to Tylenol severe cold

\- Thursday, Day 2: kinda mask and kinda don't around the house -- totally poor judgement call on my part--- just started rationalizing that I maybe had that other cold going around or even HMPV--which I should've still been masking for to protect others;  symptoms:  some head/nasal congestion; headache goes away and i think its on the mend, but it comes back; runny nose now off and on; use cough drops occasionally; some chills/sweats at night; COVID test (mouth and nose swab) = dark maroon. Damnit! We start isolation protocol right away; parents and sibling are masking, windows open etc. just really hope I can protect them/they don't catch it, and it doesn't get much worse on my part

For real though, the isolation is very boring, and the congestion is rough; it's only been 2 days, and now I'm worried for everyone, which is why I'm here.  I also can't travel back to my home cross-country until I'm negative...

Neither had typical symptoms and I only knew the kid had it because I'd read something on here about a parents kids first symptom of that strain being an earache.

"WHO says Avian flu risk still ‘low’ after first US patient dies from H5N1 virus, China hMPV ""very, very low"" risk ",2025-01-07 21:17:52,0,https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1158776,"A day after the United States reported its first human death from avian flu, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) insisted on Tuesday that the risk to the wider population remains “low”.

WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva that the H5N1 virus causing the disease is “not circulating in humans but jumping into humans” who are exposed to poultry or dairy cattle. “We’re not seeing sustained circulation,” she insisted.

The man who died of the disease in Louisiana was over 65 and reportedly had underlying medical conditions, Dr. Harris said. 

According to the health authorities, he had been exposed to chickens and wild birds. Several dozen people in the US have contracted avian influenza – commonly referred to as bird flu – during the current outbreak, mainly farmworkers in close contact with poultry flocks and cattle herds.

Dr. Harris stressed that WHO’s assessment of the risk to the general population “is still low and remains set”. The main concern is for people who work in animal industries because they need to be better protected from infection.

The WHO spokesperson added that the United States was continuing to carry out “a lot of surveillance” in the human and animal population, “in the methods we use for farming, for our food production…all those things need to be combined because indeed it always does pose a risk”.

Meanwhile, a respiratory virus gaining ground in China, known as the human metapneumovirus, or hMPV, has been sparking media attention in recent weeks, but it does not represent a new or major threat, Dr. Harris insisted.

The UN health agency spokesperson said that such infections are on the rise in China “as expected during winter”, with seasonal influenza being “by far the most common among them”, as reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

“China’s reported levels of respiratory infections are within the usual range for the winter season,” Dr. Harris explained. “Authorities report that hospital utilization is currently lower than this time last year, and there have been no emergency declarations or responses triggered,” she added.

As for hMPV, it was first identified in 2001 and “has been in the human population for a long time”, Dr. Harris clarified. 

She added that it is a common virus that circulates in winter and spring and usually “causes respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold”. 

Like any of the hundreds of common cold viruses known to exist, it can lead to more serious disease in patients with low immunity, particularly but not limited to newborns and the elderly.

Urgent Care insisting on hospital transfer for 6 year old. I have no insurance and unsure if transfer is necessary.,2022-11-20 23:33:35,156,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/z0ar22/urgent_care_insisting_on_hospital_transfer_for_6/,"My daughter has had flu symptoms for 3 days. She developed a terrible cough accompanied by rapid and rattled breathing. I brought her to urgent care and they’ve done oxygen treatment (her oxygen level was 82 and now at 100 but with the mask in place), an X-ray (showed pneumonia of lower left lung), a blood panel, covid test, and IV fluids. The doctor is saying she needs to be transferred to the children’s hospital for observation and I must opt for the ambulance given her oxygen level upon arrival at urgent care. They do not want her transported without the oxygen mask. Her health is my primary concern and I will do whatever needs to be done for her to be healthy again. My secondary concern is the costs that are stacking up. I’m already at $3k with the urgent care visit, treatments, and impending ambulance ride. I’m sure a whole other set of bills will be applied at the hospital. It’s unfathomable to me that I have to go into debt over flu/pneumonia. Their main concern is dehydration and oxygen levels. In the past I have not questioned medical advice when I should have and ended up over paying, which left me in a financially tight spot for a long time. I want to avoid that especially because I do not have any medical insurance. Do I have any options, or should I just do everything the urgent care doctor is telling me to do? I want my daughter to be healthy and comfortable, but I can’t help but wonder if they are insisting on medical intervention that’s not completely necessary. Any advice is helpful.

Texas

UPDATE 

I hope it’s okay to post an update. I really appreciate all of the informative responses to my post. You all reassured me that I made all the right decisions and that this situation is as serious as the Urgent Care doctor was stating. We took the ambulance to the children’s hospital where they immediately decided to keep my daughter overnight. It would have been a terrible outcome had we not come when we did. She was in so much distress and I honestly could not tell how bad it was. She is still working hard to breathe but it’s gotten much better. I will remember a lot of your key points for the future so I can act swiftly if we ever find ourselves in a similar situation. As far as the medical bills, I appreciate the advice and will explore every option available to me. I have been unemployed for a month but will be starting a new job in 2 weeks. I hope I am able to qualify her for Chip or Medicaid, but there seems to be additional assistance either way.

Thank you all again, from the bottom of my heart. My baby is strong and brave, and she is pulling through like a champ!

They will likely take it.\n\nIf you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you’re making the payments, it won’t get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).\n\nPlease don’t do anything drastic.

Bradycardia in 2 year old,2025-04-02 08:19:39,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jpehxt/bradycardia_in_2_year_old/,"My son A (2yrs 6mths) is kind of confusing medically. He was recently hospitalised after his heart rate dropped to 60 in his sleep and he was very difficult to rouse.

Context:
(Persistent iron deficiency, suspected malabsorption.)
He caught RSV when he was 2 weeks of age, and since then, has had dozens of ER visits, about 10 stays in the children’s ward, and maybe 7/8 ambulance calls. 
He usually ends up in the ER due to varying degrees of respiratory distress. When he gets a virus, it sometimes seems to hit him very hard, and he will begin displaying tracheal tugging, or sucking in under the ribs, sometimes nasal flaring, and he will often be tachycardic when febrile. Most of his stays result in little or no intervention: usually, they will treat with paracetamol/ibuprofen, and observe overnight or for several hours. Usual diagnosis is bronchiolitis.

He was at his sickest at 12 months old, when he developed pneumonia. In the days prior, I had observed some mild work of breathing, but he was otherwise well and happy, and the work of breathing was sporadic. His behaviour and mood were unchanged. During a night feed, I felt his belly against mine and realised he was breathing quicker than normal. That was the only sign. Ambulance, hospital, hours-long stay in resus, pneumonia. Rapidly improved with IV antibiotics and discharged following day.
The only other hospital presentations he has had, aside from respiratory (bronchiolitis/pneumonia/HMPV) have been for faecal impaction after eating sand, and gastro.

What happened:
Thursday PM/Friday AM-
Sudden onset of vomiting, some projectile, in the evening. Had noticed tummy seemed tender earlier in the afternoon. Between vomiting, seemed very pale and ‘spaced out’. Presented to ER in context of concerns about dehydration (vomited all evening, around every 40 minutes), his tender tummy earlier, and his seeming zoned out. We waited hours and he fell asleep. When we got a bed, I realised he was difficult to wake, and he didn’t wake when moved onto a bed and the nurses tried to rouse him. His heart rate was 80. We managed to rouse him, he was given ondansetron and a trial of fluids, improving over hours until we were discharged.

Monday-
He stepped on a bee at 2.30 and was stung. No reaction, redness or swelling. He was very upset, pale and irritable that evening, but we thought it was pain from the sting.
I put him to bed and lay next to him until he fell asleep. I noticed his breathing seemed shallower than usual. I put a pulse ox on him and his heart rate was 70. I called the nurse advice line, who transferred us to ambulance when it became apparent I couldn’t easily waken him. His heart rate dropped to 60 and stayed there for over half an hour.
In hospital, he had bloods, xray, urine test, ecg and continuous monitoring. His heart rate normalised while awake but once he fell asleep it hovered between 70-80, once dropping to 60 again. His o2 was always fine, high 90s. His resp rate ranged between 11-20. Everything came back “very reassuring “. They wanted to discharge us but I was scared and wanted to stay overnight.
By the next morning, he was doing much better. I pushed the paediatricians for a plan with him going forward, because it can’t be normal that he gets sick so frequently. They were mainly concerned with his continuing low iron (he’s been on oral supplements for months) and most of the discharge plan is management and follow up for that. 

Sorry, that was a lot. I just feel like I’m going crazy. It’s always “some kids just get sicker than others”. Can my son really be that unlucky?

6 month old has covid,2024-01-29 01:00:33,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1adatr7/6_month_old_has_covid/,"6 months old 
16 lbs 
No medication
No health issues



My 6 month old was hospitalized yesterday due to what they assumed was RSV. 

She has retractions, and tracheal tugging. She’s very wheezy. Her oxygen was great, as well as the xray, however when she sleeps it drops to the low 80’s so they put her on a tiny amount of oxygen 1/8th of a litre it says. She’s also vomiting and has diarrhea

Her viral swab came back positive for HMPV and Covid. 

They said as long as her oxygen is above 88 it’s fine. 

I had covid 2 weeks ago which is when I’m assuming she got it but to be this severe 2 weeks later is odd.

 I’m wondering if there’s anything else I should be asking about or if anything else should be done?

 I feel kind of brushed off with my worries considering I had a baby die of SIDS. They also don’t do continuous monitoring which I heard is normal.",[Comment(id='kk19dgq')],"[""I'm so sorry she's sick, and sorry you feel brushed off. Luckily, it sounds like she's doing ok. This is fairly routine stuff for those of us in pediatrics. Most of what she needs is some time and rest to let her body fight these viruses off, and they're going to keep on monitoring her and keeping her safe while she does that. As long as she's still drinking and having some wet diapers, nothing else that you need to ask about. I would 100% agree with intermittent (not continuous) monitoring.""]"
Human metapnuemovirus for 10 days & now positive for strep? Why? 28m,2024-03-26 03:14:25,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1bnq10p/human_metapnuemovirus_for_10_days_now_positive/,"28m

History: pots, gerd, seasonal allergies 
Meds: bisoprolol 5mg, flucitonase, lansoprazole 15mg

HPI: I felt a cold coming on (3/14) woke up and decided to get tested for covid, flu, etc on 3/15 (congestion, sinus pressure, headache) 

PCR covid and flu negative, positive for HMPV

10 days went on and the symptoms subsided but the congestion stayed and worsened, always sounded nasally and my ears were popping and sometimes felt stuffed. I figured it turned into a sinus infection.

Woke up this morning with my left tonsil inflamed and white pus spots, I knew it was likely strep. Went to urgent care to get a strep test & it was positive.

I am never sick, so this is kind of confusing to me. Is it common to develop a bacterial coinfection after a viral infection?

I will say my throat is a bit sore on the left side but I generally do no feel sick, I’ve had strep before and I usually feel terrible & run a fever, this time it’s just left side throat soreness.


TLDR;

HMPV lead to strep minimal symptoms, still congested with sinus pressure from viral infection, is this common?",[Comment(id='kwjue63')],"['Thank you for your submission. **Please note that a response does not constitute a doctor-patient relationship.** This subreddit is for informal second opinions and casual information.

"Recurrent Miscarriages, 8 weeks pregnant and  diagnosed with HMPV - human metapneumovirus",2025-03-10 08:28:45,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1j7p0jd/recurrent_miscarriages_8_weeks_pregnant_and/,"I’m 40. 4 pregnancy losses, one live birth 3 years ago. 3 losses since live birth.

Last two losses (Dec 2023 and May 2024) were chromosomal related. Last was Triploidy (maternal) and previous blighted ovum and testing not fully done unfortunately thanks to pathology screw up.

I did IVF and am 8 weeks and 2 days pregnant. PGT-A tested Euploid.

My 3 year old (who is in daycare) had a fever for 5 days from last Sunday. Runny nose and cough began earlier. Fever resolved Thursday and now kid just has runny nose and occasional cough. 

My throat began hurting a week ago and then I developed a bad cough. Like nearly crap myself bad. Can’t catch my breath in coughing fits and then triggers vomiting from pregnancy nausea at times. Saline rinses, haven’t taken anything else cuz pregnant and can’t take cough meds.

No fever for me. Been obsessively checking. Scared of risk to pregnancy and lots of trauma from the recurrent pregnancy losses. 

Went to ER last night for dizziness and felt so unwell. Also had spotting. Which I’ve had periodically for 10+ days. Doc said if I wasn’t pregnant I’d have gone for chest x ray immediately. We discussed it and decided not to x ray then due to risks in first trimester especially.

Viral swab results came back tonight on portal and positive for HMPV.

Is this going to cause risk to pregnancy? I had ultrasound at hospital and pregnancy measuring ahead by 2 days. This is my… 5th ultrasound. I have a small SCH that began bleeding 10 days ago. My biggest concern of this pregnancy before this virus was a “chorionic bump” pressing into the gestational sac. That scared the heck out of me and has my brain convinced I’m waiting on a miscarriage or stillbirth.

Now I’m worried the virus will cause loss or birth defects. I hope I didn’t miss a fever and have increase of neural tube defects now. I’ve checked my armpit and ear temp every day multiple times a day and I’ve never had even a low temp. Unless at night and I didn’t notice.

My daughter who is 4 years old had some congestion/no fever on Feb 22.  No other symptoms until her ear was hurting on March 3rd. Took her to doctor and she was diagnosed with an ear infection. Was prescribed azithromycin. It was completed on march 8th. Then on march 12 she had a fever lasting till Tuesday. I did take her to the doctor on Saturday because her fever was longer than 3 days. Doctor did say her lungs and ears were clear. I asked the doctor to run a viral respiratory panel to rule out other illness. She was lethargic on Sunday and Monday. Only waking up to take medicine. She usually would be energetic after taking medicine so I decided to take her in on Monday. the doc said she had HMPV and pneumonia. Was prescribed amoxicillin for her pneumonia. She still had a fever on Tuesday and still was tired. She is doing a lot better now. 

My question is how fast does pneumonia come on because her doctor said her lungs were clear on Saturday then to be only diagnosed with it on Monday. Do you all think she had HMPV since feb 22. Or was feb 22 a completely different virus? How long does HMPV last for?


I probably have HMPV as well. I lost all sense of small and taste. I had congestion and no fever. I took a Covid test and it was negative. I feel better but I have a dry cough that is lingering. Should I go see the doctor for the cough?
