They're all mostly nothing to write home about, causing mostly just a cold. Tho I still remember that year we had a wave of enterovirus start early and then saw an uptick in linked GBS 

I think people have just discovered that there are, in fact, other respiratory viruses other than flu and """"the common cold"""" and look out for it more often now. 

I have just told my friends to stop asking if x respiratory virus in the news that weeks is gonna be the ""next covid"" 

I'm still not sure people even realise coronaviruses aren't new, but it's not a discussion I want to have. Last coronavirus pandemic, pre cov19, was a lil over 100  years ago and is the same class as SARS, MERS, and COV so it's annoyed me from the start they just gave covid a whole ass new name. It's a beta coronavirus, and the last coronavirus to cause a pandemic is, in fact, still in circulation today and showed up every year during winter months alongside three other seasonal coronaviruses and tens of other super common seasonal respiratory viruses
